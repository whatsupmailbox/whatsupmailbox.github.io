Whats Up Mailbox was created to share my <strike>addiction</strike> love for subscription boxes and online shopping. I post and review subscription boxes, products or just about anything that comes into my mailbox (both physical and electronic!). It's so exciting to see what I receive in the mail everyday, I practically run to my mailbox as soon as I get the chance to! -I know you do too ;) Hopefully you'll find this blog to be a useful tool for you to be informed on what boxes to subscribe to and products that's right for you. And maybe you'll find yourself saying #WhatsUpMailbox the next time you check your mail =)
