I'm just a gal in sunny Los Angeles, California who loves shopping -don't we all. And what better way to do it than online with my sweats on, yeah! Then last year I was introduced to the world of subscription boxes and bamm, I was hooked. So now I subscribe to more boxes than I need to. And because of that, I created Whats Up Mailbox to share my <strike>addiction</strike> love for subscription boxes and online shopping. 

I'll post and review subscription boxes, products or just about anything that gets delivered to my mailbox (both physical and electronic!). It's so exciting to see what I receive in the mail everyday, I practically run to my mailbox as soon as I get the chance to! -I know you do too ;) Hopefully you'll find this blog to be a useful tool to be informed on what boxes to subscribe to and products that's right for you. Who knows, maybe you'll find yourself saying #WhatsUpMailbox the next time you check your mail =)
