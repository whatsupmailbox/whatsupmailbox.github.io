<p>When I first opened the box, I could smell something wonderful and sweet coming from inside -yep, that's a good sign, I'm already happy.</p>

<p>This makeup bag was revealed as one of the items earlier so I knew I was getting this and it looks even better in person. This bag also opens up like a doctor's bag so you can fit more items inside. The design reminds me a bit of Sephora though (must be the black and white stripes) but it really is beautiful and chic.</p>

<p>A look inside the bag:</p>
<center><img src='/images/PopsugarJuly2015Bag2.jpg'></center>

<p>The inside is lined with plastic material so it's liquid friendly, and you can see how the bag actually opens up.</p>

<p>I'm super happy that Popsugar decided to include a portable toothbrush and an electric one too! I can totally use this. I currently use a Sonic electric toothbrush, but it can be a bit heavy and bulky to travel. Now I don't need to and can use this instead, yay!</p>
<p>They also included a battery so you can use this right away, how thoughtful!</p>

<p>I love card holders, it's so convenient and fits well in my small clutches versus my big fat wallet. I have one in brown that I use frequently, so this red color is a great addition.</p>

<p>View of the back of the card holder:</p>
<center><img src='/images/PopsugarJuly2015Sorial.jpg'></center>
<p>The slots on the back is different where you'll get to insert more cards there versus the individual slots that's in front. They also included a coupon code for future purchases.</p>

<p>I use Supergoop for my suncare needs so I know they're a good brand and I was happy to see that they included a product from them.</p>

<p>This is my least favorite item in the box since I have a Kindle and my preference in books are more in the science fiction and non-fiction genre. I'll probably end up gifting this to someone.</p>

<p>This headband is quite wide (4" wide) and feels so soft thanks to the organic cotton. It's also multi purpose; you can use it to hold back your hair, as a wrist band, or cover your eyes during Savasana -a yoga pose of total relaxation where you close your eyes.</p>

<DD>Value $30</DD>
</DL>

<p>Sweet & Spark is a father-daughter team that searches flea markets and antique stores for unique vintage jewelry. Because of that, all items on their site only has 1 available. Prices range from $50 and can go up to $300.</p>

<p>Before the items go on sale on their website, they carefully clean each piece by hand or by ultra sonic cleaner, then finish it by triple plating them so it doesn't tarnish easily. It'll be all pretty and new again.</p>

<p>I find this company quite interesting and am happy to support any independent businesses. And FYI, the gift cards have unique codes for each subscriber.</p> 

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> When I looked at the spoilers last month, I was really excited about the sunglasses and now that I have it on hand, it'll be my go-to for sunglasses this summer. The only item I disliked was the book, and maybe I'm not alone here, but I'm not sure how a book inclusion fits with the Popsugar Must Have theme this month. The total value came up to $129.77 (that's with the gift card and using Amazon's price for the book) and that's not a bad value for a $39.95 subscription. Even without the book I would have felt like I got double my money's worth so I'm content. Next month's theme is "Beach Days, Fourth of July, Easy Travel, and Summer Heat", <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/Popsugar-Must-Have-July-2015-Spoiler-Theme/" targe="_blank"> see my post about it here </a>, and I can't wait to see some spoilers!</p>
