Ipsy always ships their glam bags in bright neon pink padded envelopes, it's hard to miss it and I always get happy when I see it in my mailbox!

<br>

Ipsy is very similar to <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Birchbox</a> where all subscribers receive different variations in their bag, and is mostly dependent on the answers you give in the Ipsy beauty quiz. They try to give you products that match your needs and concerns so not everyone will get the same items. And you can retake the beauty quiz at anytime if you feel that the products didn't really match you.

This review is for my profile so it's just one of the many variations that they sent out.

[![Info Card](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsyJune2016Info.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

Every package includes an info postcard with the theme of the month. This month's theme is "Rebel, Rebel".

<br>

[![Info Card](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsyJune2016Info2.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

The back side of the card has a short description of their Rebel theme and asking subscribers to tag their Glam Bags with a couple of hashtags.

Every month [Ipsy](https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"} sends their items in makeup bags with an exclusive design. This month's design is in line with the rebel theme hence the graffiti. It's so wild and colorful, nothing like they've ever sent before!

<br>

<H4>And here are my Ipsy June 2016 items:</H4>

<H4>Items in Detail:</H4>

[![](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsyJune2016ClariSEADeepPoreDetoxActivatedCharcoalExfoliatingMask.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

**clariSEA** Deep Pore Detox Activated Charcoal Exfoliating Mask  
Deluxe Sample Size 1 oz, *Value $4.50*

This is an all natural mask that has Bamboo Charcoal, Kaolin Clay and Calendula to blast away the dirt and oil in pores, clearing away blackheads and preventing breakouts. It's in a powder form and can be used as a cleanser or a mask! And because it's powder, you can rest assure that it won't leak in your makeup bag and take it with you when you travel.

[![ColourPop Cosmetics Creme Gel Liner](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsyJune2016ColourPopCosmeticsGelEyeLiner.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

**ColourPop Cosmetics** Crème Gel Liner in Swerve  
Full Size 0.2g, *Value $5*

*Note: Subscribers will receive the Gel Liner in either the shade Get Paid or Swerve.*

I love getting eyeliners. I wear them everyday, yes, eh-very-day, so you can see why I need them in constant supply. The color I received, Swerve, is a true onyx black color. Just my type of color so this is perfect for me.

**Elizabeth Mott** Show Me Your Cheeks Blush in Peach Pink.  
Deluxe Sample Size 2.5g (halff of full size), *Value $11.50*

The size of this sample is half of the full size and although I do love receiving blushes, the packaging on this one just seems so cheap. It's a flip top thin plastic packaging and I'm not sure how this will hold up in my makeup bag or travelling for that matter.

The blush itself is okay. The color seems universally compatible with all skin tones, and the texture is creamy so it's easily blendable and can be used with a light touch or heavier for more drama.

[![Royal & Langnickel MODA Crease Smudge Brush](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsyJune2016RoyalLangnickelMODACreaseSmudgeBrush.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

**Royal & Langnickel MODA** Crease/Smudge Brush
Double-Ended Brush, *Value $5.99?*

So I couldn't really find this exact brush being sold on their website, they only had it as a single brush and not the double-ended one. I put the value based on the single crease brush.

I LOVE getting brushes in my glam bags! You can never have enough brushes and this one is double-ended which means 2 brushes in 1! The bristles are synthetic and the handle is made of water-resistant acrylic with a Silk-Touch™ coating (for the middle section). It makes it easier to grip and non-slip too.

**theBalm Cosmetics** Meet Matt(e) Trimony Eyeshadow in Matt Moskowitz  
Tiny Sample Size 0.5g, Value $3?

*Note: Subscribers will receive this eyeshadow in either Matt Kumar or Matt Moskowitz.*

I like getting eyeshadows but this sample is tiny! I've received these tiny samples from this brand before, it was a blush and bronzer though, so I am willing to try this out. The color I received, Matt Moskowitz, is a matte plum color which works well for me as I do tend to use that type of color a lot.

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> So I gotta be honest, I wasn't too excited when I got a peek at my glam bag items earlier this month, and having it on hand didn't change that either. The only saving grace are the eyeshadow brush and eyeliner, and those two alone made me break even with the $10 cost of this subscription. The total value of my items this month didn't amount to much either, definitely way lower than what I'm used to getting so that was also a bummer. I guess it's time for me to update my profile preference to see if that will make a difference for next month's glam bag. Really hoping it will!
