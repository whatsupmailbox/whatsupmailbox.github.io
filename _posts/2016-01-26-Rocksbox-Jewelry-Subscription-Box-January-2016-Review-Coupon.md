<p>I love to accessorize my outfit with jewelry and I do tend to purchase quite a few of them from time to time, but I also get bored or feel like the style is outdated soon after. That's why I decided to try out Rocksbox. This way I can wear current styles from amazing brands and switch them up as often as I want depending on how fast I ship them back. I already have a feeling I'm going to love this box.</p>

<DT><b>House of Harlow 1960</b> Sunburst Bar Wrap Necklace in Gold</DT>
<DD>Retail Value $38 (Insider's Price $30)</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Size: 36-38" long</i></p>

<p>This necklace is long, which is great to wear by itself or to layer with other delicate necklaces. I layered it with some Gorjana pieces and it looked perfect! And not only that, it can also be wrapped around twice so you have a double necklace look, how cool is that. Another great item choice for me!</p>

<DT><b>CC Skye</b> Call Me Necklace in Gold</DT>
<DD>Retail Value $68 (Insider's Price $54)</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Size: 17.5" long</i></p>

<p>The style of this necklace is so totally me. I love geometric shapes and delicate necklaces. I love it cause it's both feminine and edgy, which is my type of style. Plus it's also 18k gold plated!</p>

<p>The wide triangle-shaped pendant is encrusted with shimmering rhinestones. I love how it sparkles and yet not overly sparkling. It looks great on my neckline. It's sleek and elegant with a modern touch. This one is a perfect item choice for me!</p>
