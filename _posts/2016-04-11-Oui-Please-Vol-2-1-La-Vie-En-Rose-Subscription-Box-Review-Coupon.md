<p><i class="icon-dropbox"></i> Oui Please safely packs their precious boxes inside a bigger black packaging box. They are also shipped through UPS Ground so if you're registered with My UPS, you'll get notification as soon as it's shipped and tracking details too. It took 3 days for me to receive mine!</p>
<br>

<p>At first glance, you see a big cardstock sign with a French statement. They send one with every box and I collect them all to frame. It's a simple yet chic way to decorate any wall.</p>

<br>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPlease21Box.jpg'></center>
<p>These boxes are my absolute favorite boxes from any subscription out there. It's gorgeous as a storage compartment, plus it's so BIG and sturdy, you can definitely use this for so many things. It also feels like a quality box made from high quality materials and you just know something luxurious is inside.</p>

<br>

<p>This month's ribbon is pink, fitting for the rose theme, and you also see the info magazine for Vol. 2.1.</p>

<br>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPlease21Info.jpg'></center>
<p>Oui Please always includes a catalog magazine listing all the items that were included for the current Volume box. I think it's great and so informational, plus they're made with such good quality, I collect all of them to browse around when I have French withdrawals.</p>
<br>

<p>Here's a look at some of the pages:</p>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPlease21LesPetitesParisScarf2.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT><b>Les Petites... Paris</b> Scarf - A OuiPlease Exclusive</DT>
<DD>Value $120</DD>
</DL>

<p>This is a OuiPlease exclusive item, so the next time you're out and about and see someone with this scarf, say, "Bonjour my fellow OuiPlease-er!" I'm totally going to do that =)</p>

<br>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPlease21LesPetitesParisScarf3.jpg'></center>

<p>I love the color and pattern of this scarf. It'll be great during summer and I plan on wearing this tied in a knot around my neck with a white crisp shirt for that chic look. All I need is a vintage convertible and Saint Tropez as my backdrop to complete this look.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Pluie Detoiles Bijoux</b> Bangle Bracelet</DT>
<DD>Value $70</DD>
</DL>

<p>This is a gold plated adjustable bangle bracelet that has arrow patterns on it. It's perfect for the upcoming festival season (a.k.a Coachella fever!) or even for the spring and summer casual style.</p>

<br>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPlease21PluieDetoilesBijouxIloeBangleBracelet3.jpg'></center>

<p>The inside of the bangle has the brand's imprint on it. I totally love this bracelet and am wearing it already!</p> 

<br>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPlease21ConcertoNo1RainaRing.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT><b>Concerto No. 1</b> Ring</DT>
<DD>Value $50</DD>
</DL>

<p>Rings are such a hit and miss for me due to my petite fingers, and of course this one was too big as usual. I do love the design though, it's totally me and totally what I would wear. Sadly I must gift this ring to someone very lucky, sigh.<p>

<br>

<center><OuiPlease21NuxeGentleExfoliatingGel.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT><b>Nuxe</b> Gentle Exfoliating Gel</DT>
<DD>Value $24</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've used this brand before and it's great. This gel will gently exfoliate and elimiate dead skin cells so you can achieve a refined, softened and radiant skin that's spring and summer ready!</p>

<br>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPlease21LaFare1789IntenseNightCream.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT><b>La Fare 1789</b> Intense Night Cream</DT>
<DD>Value $25</DD>
</DL>

<p>The key ingredients of this night cream include Macadamia, sesame, edelweiss and hibiscus that will work together to promote cell renewal for fresh and radiant skin.</p>

<br>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPlease21OlivLaClareeEyeAndLipsSmoothingGel.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT><b>Oliv' La Claree</b> Eyes and Lips Smoothing Gel</DT>
<DD>Value $50</DD>
</DL>

<p>This gel softens lips and resurfaces fine wrinkles with hydrating nourishing agents. The bottle is enclosed with a dropper for an easy and effecient application.</p>

<p>I'm definitely intrigued by this product, not only because I want to test out its smoothing powers on my lips that tend to get dry a lot, but also because it's $50 for a bottle that's quite small.</p>

<br>

<center><img src='/images/OuiPlease21LeChocolatDesFrancaisChocolateBars.jpg'></center>
<DL>
<DT><b>Le Chocolat Des Francaise</b> Chocolate Bars</DT>
<DD>Value $15 (for 2 chocolate bars)</DD>
</DL>

<p>Chocolates, yum! Plus these are made with 100% pure cocoa butter and without palm oil. Can't say no to 100% natural chocolate but I'm in love with the cute and colorful designs of the covers, it'll be hard for me to eat them!</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> <b>My Thoughts:</b> I like the variation of items that were in this volume's box, especially the Les Petites... Paris exclusive scarf, what a treat! Kind of sad that the ring was too big for me, especially since I actually loved it. Everything else will surely be used and I must say that although this box's value wasn't as high as my previous one, it still felt luxe and very french. I'm hoping that in the future there will be more inclusions of bags or clutches like in the past, so here's to hoping. Their next box Vol. 2.2: Joie De Vivre will be shipping next month in May, and no spoilers have come out yet as to what would be included. But hopefully something that'll be great for summer!</p>
