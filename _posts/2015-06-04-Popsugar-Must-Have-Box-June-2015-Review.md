<p><b>Box:</b> <a href="http://http://popsu.gr/vdrb">Popsugar Must Have</a> Special Edition Summer Box</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $100 (additional taxes apply to CA)</p>
<p><b>What's in the box:</b> A special curation of summer's hottest essentials. Value of items have always been double at the least.</p>
<br>

The theme for this summer is "Set Sail With The Season's Hottest Essentials".

<DT>Dark Cocoa Nom Noms</DT>
<DD>Mini Cocoa Oat Cookies, 3.7 oz.</DD>
</DL>
<p>These are similar to no-bake cookies where it's soft and chewy, which I love. But unfortunately I'm not a dark chocolate person, plus it had coconut which is definitely a taste I'm not too fond of. If you like dark chocolate and coconut, this is definitely for you!</p>

<DT>Sweet Blueberry Almonds</DT>
<DD>Blueberry flavored almonds, 1 oz.<DD>
</DL>
<p>I loved this. It was sweet and almondy good, with the added bonus of blueberry flavor. Great snack for when you want something sweet and fulfilling.</p>

<br>

<p><b>VERDICT:</b> I loved every single item from this box and I'm so glad I bought it (I was contemplating since the last Special Edition box was less than stellar). Everything is perfect for summer and definitely fits in with their sailing theme. The bag and bracelet alone made this box a win for me. The total value came up to $300 which is triple the cost!</p>
