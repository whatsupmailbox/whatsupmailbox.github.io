This month their theme was "Yoga Warrior . Sun Kissed . Outdoor Fun . Coconut".

<p>They always include a fold out card that details all the items and prices. I typically read it towards the end of my unboxing, this way I don't get any spoilers and can ooohh and aaahh first, then read about them later -but that's just silly old me.</p>

<DT>Dark Cocoa Nom Noms</DT>
<DD>Mini Cocoa Oat Cookies, 3.7 oz.</DD>
<p>These are similar to no-bake cookies where it's soft and chewy, which I love. But unfortunately I'm not a dark chocolate person, plus it had coconut which is definitely a taste I'm not too fond of. If you like dark chocolate and coconut, this is definitely for you!</p>

<DT>Sweet Blueberry Almonds</DT>
<DD>Blueberry flavored almonds, 1 oz.<DD>
<p>I loved this. It was sweet and almondy good, with the added bonus of blueberry flavor. Great snack for when you want something sweet and fulfilling.</p>

<p><b>VERDICT:</b> I think this box represented the theme they had and I'm in love with 2 of the big ticket items so I'm happy with that. The total value of this box came up to $114 and although it's not my favorite box from them, I'll still use most of the items so I got my money's worth. I'm excited for the June 2015 box though since they released a <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/popsugar/Popsugar-June2015-Spoiler/">spoiler item</a> just a few days ago and that item alone is worth more than the subscription! Hint, it's perfect for sunny summer days. Check out my <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/popsugar/Popsugar-June2015-Spoiler/">Popsugar Spoiler news</a> I posted to see what it is. Here's hoping to a better box in June!</p>
