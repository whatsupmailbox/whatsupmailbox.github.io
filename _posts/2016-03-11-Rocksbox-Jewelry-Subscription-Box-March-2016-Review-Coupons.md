<p><a href="https://www.rocksbox.com" target="_blank">Rocksbox</a> always sends out their jewels in these cute little boxes that are enclosed with a ribbon. Once you're done using the jewelry and want to receive new ones, all you have to do is put them back into this box and ship it out with the padded envelope that it was in, as well as the included return address label. Super easy and convenient!</p>

<p>I love the way they package it with a chic tissue paper, so fashionable and it adds to the unboxing experience.</p>

<br>

<p>They also always include a personalized note with your name on it. Inside of this note is a list of items you received in this box and a note from your stylist as to why she chose them for you.</p>

<p><i>Size: 1.44"L x 0.69"W on earwire</i></p>

<p>I love Kendra Scott and I have quite a few of her pieces in my collection. These earrings are 14K gold plated over brass and the large stone is made of Amethyst. It's a light purple color and the stone is see through.</p>

<p>At first I was disappointed to get purple since it is one of my least favorite colors (I need to put this in my profile), but it's growing on me and it's quite light in color so it's not too prominent in color. I tried it on and it actually looks great on me, so I'm really happy with that.</p>

<p>When I sent my last Rocksbox back, I communicated with my stylist that I wanted to try bolder and more statement necklaces, so she sent this for me to try out.</p>

<p>I love pink so that's was already a hit, and this necklace was both feminine yet still bold in style. Love this.</p>

<p>I love this necklace. Its style is edgy which I prefer and yet glamorous. I can't wait to wear this with my LBD!</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Finally a package where I'm in love with all 3 items! I love that you can write feedback to your stylist about the items you received and relay to her what you liked or disliked, as well as what you'd like to see in your next shipment. They do read them and try their best to fulfill your requests, so don't be shy in communicating what your thoughts are, I sure wasn't and am so glad that my stylist listened to my requests. I'm bringing all 3 of these items to my vacation trip next week and can't wait to wear them all.</p>
