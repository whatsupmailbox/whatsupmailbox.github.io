<li>Ipsy March 2016 Glam Bag</li>
<li>NYX Cosmetics - Liquid Suede Cream Lipstick</li>
<li>TEMPTU - Warm Glow Bronzer</li>
<li>Me me me - Loose Powder Brush</li>
<li>Living Proof - Perfect hair Day Dry Shampoo</li>

<br>

<p>I'm super happy that I'll be getting a face brush this month, beauty tools are always welcomed into my mailbox! I'm also a big fan of the Living Proof Perfect hair Day (PhD) dry shampoo and already have the full size in my collection, so the one I'll be getting will totally be used for traveling.</p>

<p>Other than those 2 items, I can't really say I'm too excited about the rest, but as usual, I say that now and once I have the products in hand I tend to change my mind.</p>

<p>Did you access your Glam Bag early? What are you getting?</p>
