<p>This month Little Lace Box and Serendipity (by LLB) were sent together in a combined box due to some delays in production. I don't think subscribers were informed about this delay, I sure wasn't and only found out when they sent the notification that the box was sent which was a few days before the box actually arrived. I don't mind the delay at all, but I think it would have been nice to let subscribers know and keep us in the loop.</p>

<p>This month's red box didn't have the typical LLB sticker on it, it was unmarked and I only knew it was from LLB because they're the only ones that send out these bright red boxes. I wonder why no sticker though?</p>

## And here are the items for this month's LLB & Serendipity:

<p>It doesn't seem like there's a lot of items for 2 subs, but more on that later.</p>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

<center><img src='/images/LLBAugust2015Vase.jpg'></center>

<DL>
<DT><a href="http://www.sandiegohat.com/store/women-s-ultrabraid-large-brim-visor.html" target="_blank">San Diego Hat Co. - The Packable Summer Hat in Black & White Stripes</a></DT>
<DD>Value $128</DD>
</DL>

<p>I decided to start off with the most expensive item in the box. It's a handmade vase from England that was designed exclusively for LLB's "Elizabeth & Darcy" theme. Although I do appreciate receiving a vase, I think I would have preferred a bigger less expensive vase that didn't take up the value of the whole box.</p>

<p>Just so you have an idea of the size of this vase, I set it next to a Perrier can:</p>
<center><img src='/images/LLBAugust2015Vase2.jpg'></center>

<p>As you can see from the above picture, it's quite small and short. It is beautiful, but the color or style doesn't match my decor so I'm still on the fence about keeping this or gifting it.</p> 
<br>

<p>Receiving fragrance in my subscription boxes isn't my favorite, plus it's not a spray bottle which I prefer and the scent didn't do it for me, so it was kind of disappointing. The scent is floral and sweet with a slight musk. I'm more of a fresh, floral kind of girl. I'll definitely be gifting this.</p> 
<br>

<DL>
<DT>Little Lace Box - Pour Some Sugar Scrub On Me in Lollabambooza</DT>
<DD>Full Size 8 oz., Value $19.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>I loved the sugar scrub they sent out in the last box and I did send out a request to have it made in a lotion as well, so I'm glad they listen to their subscribers and actually made them. I got a different scent this time though, and it smells great.</p>

<p>This lotion has 30% shea butter, so it's uber rich in moisturization and will most likely be used in the winter for me.</p>

<DL>
<DT>Watercolor Print Silk Scarf exclusively made for LLB</DT>
<DD>Value $45.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've heard of this company before and had it in my list to try them out for some flower arrangements, but just never got around to it, so I'm happy I get to now. The flowers are freshly cut upon order and sourced from local growers. With that fact combined with reasonable pricing and great floral arrangements, this just might be my new go-to for my floral needs. I can't wait to use this gift card!</p>

## Serendipity Items

<DL>
<DT>Kitsch - Ring with Amethyst stone</a></DT>
<DD>Value $24.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>Oh how I wish I had normal sized fingers. I have petite, and I mean super petite (think size 3.5) fingers so sadly I won't be able to wear this -but I really want to! The ring was made exclusively for LLB and it's also made from 14K gold with high quality stones. Subscribers either got the Amethyst stone or the Turquoise stone, and they both look lovely.</p>

<DT><a href='http://www.lucybcosmetics.com/nails2.php#' target="_blank">Lucy B. Cosmetics - Nail Lacquer in Starlet</a></DT>
<DD>Full Size 12ml, Value $13</DD>
</DL>

<p>Lucy B. Cosmetics was founded by Lucy Baldock-Sacchi who was a make-up artist to celebrities for over fifteen years before she founded the company with her top advertising Photographer husband, Marco Sacchi. Their products are natural and organic, and they are the only fragrance and colour range in the world to have infused the natural Australian Flower Essences within their products.</p>
<p>The color Starlet looks very natural on nails, I would say it's a light nude peach, definitely an everyday type of color. It also dries pretty quick to my surprise! This nail lacquer is 4-free of Formaldehyde, Toluene, Dibutyl Phthalate (DBP), and Camphor. Plus LLB paired the colors of the nail polishes with the type of ring they included. So if you received the Amethyst ring, you'll receive this Starlet color. If you got the Turquoise ring, you'll get the Premier color which is a more taupe color. LLB always thinks of everything!</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Sadly this month was a miss for me. For the Little Lace Box, although the value is quite high, most of it went to the vase which is an item that not everyone would love. I think a high value item should be something that's more streamlined and accepted by their audience. For Serendipity, the items were less than stellar especially when compared to the previous one. You can read my July Serendipity review here. I think the only items I'll be using from this box is the bouqs.com gift card and the tea steaper. Everything else will most likely be gifted or traded. I still love LLB, no love lost here, it's just that this month's theme and items were not my cup of tea. Looking at the theme for the next box which is "XXXXX", I think that might fit me better and hopefully curated better.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://littlelacebox.com?rfsn=93842.4b16b" target="_blank"><big>subscribe here</big></a> to start receiving their next box which will be in August, and the theme for that box is "Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy".
