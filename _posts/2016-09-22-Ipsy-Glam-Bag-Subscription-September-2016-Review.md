Ipsy always ships their glam bags in bright neon pink padded envelopes. It stands out in your mailbox and you can't miss when it actually arives!

<br>

Ipsy is very similar to <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Birchbox</a> where all subscribers receive different variations in their bag, and is mostly dependent on the answers you give in the Ipsy beauty quiz. They try to give you products that match your needs and concerns so not everyone will get the same items. And you can retake the beauty quiz at anytime if you feel that the products didn't really match you.

This review is for my profile so it's just one of the many variations that they sent out.

First peek at unboxing shows the gorgeous glam bag and their post card! This month's theme is Glamazon!

<br>

<H4>The Glam Bag:</H4>

This month's glam bag is cute! The girls on the bag spell out the word "IPSY" and they remind me of cheerleaders minus the pom poms =)

<br>

<H4>And here are my Ipsy September 2016 items:</H4>

<H4>Items in Detail:</H4>

**Dirty Little Secret Cosmetics** Eyeshadow in Teaser  
1.5 g, *Estimated Value $7*

<br>

I've never heard of this brand before, and their site only has eyeshadows in a palette, not in single compacts like this one so I estimated the value. The color is a nice everyday natural-looking shade that can be used as a base or as an allover crease color.

<br>

[![Eyeko London Eye Do Liquid Eyeliner in Black](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsySeptember2016EyekoLondonEyeDoLiquidEyeliner.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?cid=ppage_ref&sid=link&refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

**Eyeko London** Eye Do Liquid Eyeliner in Black  
Travel Size 1.2 g., *Value $12*

<br>

I've used Eyeko eyeliners in the past, and eyeliners are one of those things that I am always in constant need of so I was happy to receive this. One unique thing about this particular eyeliner is that it features WIDELASH lash enhancer. It helps eyelashes appear longer, fuller and stronger with up to 3 times more volume in just 15 days of regular use. I shall have to test that out and hope it's true because who doesn't want longer and fuller eyelashes!

<br>

[![IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsySeptember2016ItCosmeticsSuperheroMascara.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?cid=ppage_ref&sid=link&refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

<br>

[![IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsySeptember2016ItCosmeticsSuperheroMascara02.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?cid=ppage_ref&sid=link&refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

**IT** Cosmetics Superhero Mascara in Super Black  
Deluxe Sample Size 0.17 fl. oz., *Value $13.33*

<br>

I'm a big fan of IT Cosmetics and I actually have this mascara in Full Size already so I know this is a great mascara. 

<br>

[![IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsySeptember2016ItCosmeticsSuperheroMascara03.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?cid=ppage_ref&sid=link&refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

The brush looks pretty standard but combined with the formula, it really doubles if not triples the volume of your lashes and it also creates a thicker lash line. I personally am not blessed with long and full eyelashes so this was a life saver and has been my go-to mascara for awhile now.

<br>

[![Buff Her House Of Exfoliation Vanilla Almond Crumbles Scrub](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsySeptember2016BuffHerHouseOfExfoliationVanillaAlmondCrumblesScrub.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?cid=ppage_ref&sid=link&refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

**Buff Her House Of Exfoliation** Vanilla Almond Crumbles Scrub
Deluxe Sample Size .9 oz. Jar, *Value $7*

<br>

I already have a scrub that I use and love, plus my skin is quite sensitive when it comes to skincare so I may just have to gift this. I'm also not a big fan of sweet scents for my skincare, so that was another miss for me. I'm not sure why this was sent in my glam bag as I had skincare unselected in my profile. Oh well, I guess it's time for me to update my beauty profile again...

<br>

[![Nuxe Moisturizing Mask Creme Fraiche De Beaute](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsySeptember2016NuxeMoisturizingMaskCremeFraicheDeBeaute.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?cid=ppage_ref&sid=link&refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

**Nuxe** Moisturizing Mask Crème Fraîche De Beauté  
Deluxe Sample Size 15 ml., Value $8

<br>

"A source of well-being and immediate freshness, this moisturizing mask with Plant Milks and White Blossom provides intensive moisturization even for the driest of skins. A rescue skincare, it provides intensive relief, instantly soothing skin discomfort. Hydrates and soothes for 24 hours, leaving skin radiant."

This mask will be great for the winter months when skin tends to get dry, and a super rich moisturizer or mask will surely help. 

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This month was a bit of a hit and miss. The hits were the Eyeko eyeliner and IT Cosmetics mascara, but everything else was a bit of a miss for me. For the $10 cost of this sub, it was still worth it though as I received two items that I love and will be using, so I'm happy with that. I think I need to go back and refresh my beauty profile to see if that will help in receiving better products that match my needs. Hopefully it does and next month will be a better glam bag for me!
