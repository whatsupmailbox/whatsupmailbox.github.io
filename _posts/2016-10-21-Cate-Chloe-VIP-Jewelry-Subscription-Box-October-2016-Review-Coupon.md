After unwrapping the packaging, you see their info card stating "Hey, VIP", that's me!

<br>

The Info Card:

Cate & Chloe sends their jewelry items in these cute boxes. It definitely makes a difference to find your jewelry packaged in cute and reusable boxes versus a cheap and regular plastic packaging.

<br>

<H4>And here are my items for this month:</H4>

[![Cate & Chloe VIP September 2016 Items](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPOctober2016Items.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

[![Cate & Chloe Lucia Gifted Triangle Gold Drop Earrings](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPOctober2016MelMagnificentRingGold02.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe Mel Magnificent Ring Gold](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPOctober2016MelMagnificentRingGold.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

**Mel "Magnificent" Ring - Gold**, *Value $49*

This ring is gold plated and lined with Cubic Zirconia. It's gorgeous and just my style. It's a one size fits all so you can be sure it'll fit your fingers. Unfortunately my fingers are super petite (I'm a size 3.5 in ring size!) so it was too big for me to even try on. Such a bummer cause I really LOVE this. In my opinion, without adjusting it, it should fit a size 6 and above.

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe Hazel Brave Earrings](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPOctober2016HazelBraveEarrings.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe Hazel Brave Earrings](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPOctober2016HazelBraveEarrings02.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

**Hazel "Brave" Earrings**, *Value $52*  

Statement earrings are SO me, and I'm so happy I got this! It consists of 2 parts, the stud and the drop. You can wear it together to get the look above, or separate the stud section on top to wear it alone for a more minimal look.

<br>

Here's how it looks on me:

[![Cate & Chloe Hazel Brave Earrings](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPOctober2016HazelBraveEarrings03.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

I wore it all day and it wasn't heavy at all. Definitely got compliments, and the blush pink and white stones adds a feminine touch to this modern and bold look. Love it!

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe Melanie Wish 18K Gold 3 Piece Layered Necklace](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPOctober2016MelanieWishGoldLayeredNecklace.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

**Melanie "Wish" 18K Gold 3 Piece Layered Necklace**, *Value $65*

*Size: Chain Size: 10 in. with 2 in. extender*

<br>

This 3 piece layered necklace is 18k gold plated with a Turquoise circle, gold bar, and Wishbone pendant. I love the combo and it just works. 

<br>

And here's how it looks on me:

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe Melanie Wish 18K Gold 3 Piece Layered Necklace](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPOctober2016MelanieWishGoldLayeredNecklace02.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

It goes really well with the Hazel earrings, I really love the look! Now if only the ring would fit me too, that would totally complete it!

<br>

<H4>Bonus Item:</H4>

[![Cate & Chloe VIP - Manna Kadar Fantasy 3-in-1 Blush Highlighter Eyeshadow](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPOctober2016MannaKadarFantasy3in1BlushHighlighterEyeshadow.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe VIP - Manna Kadar Fantasy 3-in-1 Blush Highlighter Eyeshadow](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPOctober2016MannaKadarFantasy3in1BlushHighlighterEyeshadow02.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

**Manna Kadar** Fantasy 3-in-1 Blush Highlighter Eyeshadow, Full Size. *Value $19*

This is the "Perk of the Month" item and I'm already a big fan of this cosmetic brand so I was happy to find it in the box.

"Our Fantasy 3-in-1 is a pearlized powder blush, highlighter and eyeshadow in a champagne pink shade. It has a special light and velvet-like texture which glides on smoothly and evenly to provide the perfect amount of color for a healthy glow on your eyes, cheeks or desired areas for highlighting."

<br>

Here's a little info about the brand on the info card:

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe VIP October 2016 Perk of the Month](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPOctober2016MannaKadarInfo.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

It also gives tips on how to use it as an eyeshadow, how to highlight perfectly, and even using it on top of your lipstick for a metallic look! I need to try that.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** As always, Cate & Chloe delivered beautiful jewelry items that are totally my style. The layered necklace has now become my go-to necklace, and the earrings, I would have bought them myself if I saw it in a store. Although the ring was a bit big on me, to be fair, no one makes rings in size 3.5 so that's on me. The bonus item this month was also a great item. I know the brand and am already a fan so that was a major plus for me.
