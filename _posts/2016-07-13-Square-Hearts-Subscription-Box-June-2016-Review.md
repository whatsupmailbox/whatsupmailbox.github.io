![Square Hearts June 2016 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SquareHeartsJune2016Box.jpg)

**Subscription:** [Square Hearts](https://www.squarehearts.com){:target="_blank"}

**Cost:** $49.99/monthly + Free Shipping.

**What's in the box:** Receive a selection of fashionable items that include Clothing, Accessories and Beauty products.

<br>

I'm always up for trying new subscription boxes and I've heard of this one through their clever Instagram marketing (a very convincing video) showing a box with clothing, accessories and beauty products so I figured, let's try it! And they had this special promo that included free beauty products on top of your regular box, and one of those products was a Hey Gorge leave-in hair conditioner that I love, so that pretty much sealed the deal for me.

<br>

First look at unboxing shows the little silver pouch bag on the left which I assume is the free gift promo. On top of the package is their info card.

Once you unpack the tissue paper, you finally see the actual items inside. I wonder what that black clothing item will be?

<br>

<H4>The Info Card:</H4>

The info card details the items that were included in your box as well as some styling tips.

<br>

<H4>And here are my Square Hearts June 2016 Items:</H4>

I'm not quite sure yet what to make of the items, they look like a good mix and variety of products, so we shall see.

<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

![Square Hearts June 2016 Wallet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SquareHeartsJune2016Wallet.jpg)

**Double-Zipper Wallet with Hand Strap**

<br>

So I'm not a big fan of this, it looks like something you get from a cheap store and it had no brand name on it either so that was a complete disappointment.

<br>

Inside the wallet you see all the slots for your credit cards. The other zipper is to contain all your loose change and cash.

<br>

![Square Hearts June 2016 Wallet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SquareHeartsJune2016Wallet3.jpg)

The hand strap was included for you to attach to the wallet. Although I may have liked this type of wallet if it was of better quality (and of a brand that I know), unfortunately this was a total miss and will be passed along to someone who will actually use it.

<br>

![Square Hearts June 2016 Black Romper](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SquareHeartsJune2016BlackRomper.jpg)

**Black Romper**, Size Small

<br>

I love rompers so I was quite happy to see this. It did fit me well, not too loose or tight, but again the quality is just not as I would like it to be. You could compare this to something you would get at Charlotte Ruse. Oh well, at least it fits and I will be wearing this at some point.

<br>

![Square Hearts June 2016 Free To Live Panties](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SquareHeartsJune2016FreeToLivePanties.jpg)

**Free To Live** Panties, Size Small

<br>

I've only received panties one time from a subscription box and that particular one was Made in France because it came from Oui Please, a subscription box of all things French (read my Oui Please review here). This one is far from that. It is functional and it will be used, so I guess it's o-kay.

<br>

![Square Hearts June 2016 Charlie B Leave In Hair Conditioner](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SquareHeartsJune2016CharlieBLeaveInHairConditioner.jpg)

**Charlie B.** Leave In Hair Conditioner

<br>

I do love me some leave in hair conditioners so this was happily accepted.

<br>

![Square Hearts June 2016 Nabi Nail Polish](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SquareHeartsJune2016NabiNailPolish.jpg)

**Nabi** Nail Polish in

<br>

Nail polishes are something that I love to collect and this color is great for summer.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** So this was my first Square Hearts box and honestly, it will be my last. I am not impressed by the quality of the items especially for a $49.99 box. When compared to other subscription boxes at that price point, you receive much more value and products that come from a well known brand. The idea is great, a curation of clothing, accessories and beauty products, but sadly they send out items that are cheap and of low quality. Maybe it's just me and maybe I'm just too spoiled with what other subscription boxes send out, but hey, if I'm paying the same and get better products elsewhere, I'm going elsewhere. But that's just me.
