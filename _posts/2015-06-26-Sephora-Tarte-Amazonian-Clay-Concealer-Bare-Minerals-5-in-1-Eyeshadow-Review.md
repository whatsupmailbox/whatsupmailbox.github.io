<H4>Here are the items I purchased online and received this week:</H4>

<p>It's been years since I first used this magic wand and I can't stop using it. The color is a perfect match and I actually have this in both Medium and Tan. I use the Medium color when I get lighter during the winter and Tan during the summer </p>
