**Sock Eden** Socks, *Value $15*

 I just adore the logo of these socks, so dapper and cute! I also love the pairing of the dark blue, grey and red colors. They will definitely add some color to my husband's attire.

<br>

[![Gentlemen Essentials Neck Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxFebruary2017GentlemenEssentialsNeckTie.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

[![Gentlemen Essentials Neck Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxFebruary2017GentlemenEssentialsNeckTie02.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

**Gentlemen Essentials** Neck Tie, *Value $29*

This tie is made of 100% cotton and the red color will tie the socks together nicely. It's fitting for the month of February and will make a great tie for a special Valentine's dinner date.

<br>

[![Gentlemen Essentials Pocket Square](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxFebruary2017GentlemenEssentialsPocketSquare.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

**Gentlemen Essentials** Pocket Square, *Value $19*

A pocket square from the same brand! And it matches too of course! That's to be expected of course as this box always sends items that compliment each other. 

<br>

[![Gentlemen Essentials Pocket Square](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxFebruary2017GentlemenEssentialsPocketSquare02.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

The pocket square itself is 10" in size and is made from cotton. It's more of a casual pocket square when compared to other more silky ones, so it'll go great with your summer suits, sport jackets or casual button downs that's paired with jeans.

**Detroit Grooming Co.** Comb/Bottle Opener, *Value $25*

This 4" stainless steel comb not only grooms you, but opens your beer bottles too! Let's all take a moment to admire this cool nifty little tool! Aaaahhhhh...

I appreciate the travel friendly size and that it's made in the U.S., Detroit to be exact. And you'll certainly be the <strikethrough>talk</strikethrough> star of the party when you bring this with you to your next party.

[![Harry's Face Wash Samples](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxFebruary2017HarrysFaceWash.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

**Harry's** Face Wash, *Samples*

My husband actually has a Harry's razor set that's even engraved with his initials, thanks to his thoughtful wife. But he's never tried the face wash before and is a bit picky about the type of soap he uses for his face, so this sample will be great to try.

<br>

**Ivory Clasp $25 Coupon**

I've never heard of this subscription before, but it's a monthly or bi-monthly delivery of handbags valued at over $100 for $45/month (bi-month). With this coupon, it brings down the cost to only $20, so I might just have to try this!

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** The items this month seemed like a great curation for a gentleman who's preparing himself for a special dinner date. It has all the matching and dapper accessories to compliment an outfit, and the comb/bottle opener will definitely be a conversation starter. Very fitting for February that you can use for yourself or even gift for that single buddy of yours, he'll thank you for sure.
