Here's what I'll be getting this month:

<ul>
<li>Ipsy October 2016 Glam Bag</li>
<li>MAKE UP FOR EVER - Ultra HD Invisible Cover Foundation</li>
<li>Kokie Cosmetics - Kokie Nail Polish in Heavenly</li>
<li>NYX Professional Makeup - Vivid Brights Liner in Vivid Gunmetal</li>
<li>tre'StiQue - Matte Lip Crayon in Belize Bordeaux or Florence Fig</li>
<li>BeFine Food Skin Care - Exfoliating Cleanser</li>
</ul>

<br>

I'm happy to receive a nail polish, but that color... not so sure about that. Everything else is just meh, at least for now, I guess I'll just wait to see if I still feel the same once I have the products on hand.
