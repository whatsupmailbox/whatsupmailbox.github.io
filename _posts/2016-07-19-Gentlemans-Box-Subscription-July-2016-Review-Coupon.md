<br>


[![Open Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJuly2016OpenBox.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS)

I love the uplifting words that are printed on the inside cover, Look Good - Feel Good - Be Good!

<br>

<figcaption>First look at unboxing</figcaption>

<br>

This month includes a couple of boxed items. Interesting... can't wait to see what they are!

<br>

<p><b>Info Magazine:</b></p>

<center>*Table of Contents*</center>

The info magazine that they include with every box are so very useful. It details each item in the box as well as the brand/creator behind it.

<br>

They also include a section on how to wear all the items in the box all together for a super dapper look!

<br>

<H4>And here are all the items:</H4>

[![Gentleman's Box July 2016 Items](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJuly2016Items.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS)

I'm loving the colors this month brings, bright red with vintage browns.

<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

[![Kiko Brown Leather Wallet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJuly2016KikoLeatherWallet.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS)

**Kiko** Brown Leather Wallet, *Value $45*

<br>

I think this is the first time ever I received a leather wallet from a subscription, how awesome. The leather is soft and the brown color is vintage and classic indeed. 

<br>

![Kiko Brown Leather Wallet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJuly2016KikoLeatherWallet2.jpg)

The inside has 4 card slots and a long section to keep your cash organized. An all around great wallet!

<br>

[![Gentlemen Essentials Leather Shoe Horn](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJuly2016GentlemenEssentialsLeatherShoeHorn.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS)

**Gentlemen Essentials** Leather Shoe Horn, *Value $25*

<br>

Leather shoe horns are a luxury to have. It beats plastic cheap looking ones that you see in typical department stores by a longshot.

<br>

[![Gentlemen Essentials Leather Shoe Horn](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJuly2016GentlemenEssentialsLeatherShoeHorn2.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS)

I like that it comes with a strap, so you can hang it somewhere so it's easy to find versus rummaging through a drawer to find it.

<br>


[![William Sterling Premium No Show Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJuly2016WilliamSterlingNoShowSocks.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS)

**William Sterling** Premium No Show Socks, *Value $10*

<br>

No show socks are a must during the hot summer season. The colors on this one is perfect for July. It has red, white and blue, very patriotic indeed.

<br>

[![Nikolas Ryan Pocket Square](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJuly2016NikolasRyanPocketSquare.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS)

**Nikolas Ryan** Pocket Square, *Value $15*

<br>

I am loving this pocket square. Both the design and color is so popping bright that it will certainly compliment any outfit this summer.

<br>

[![Balla Body Powder](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJuly2016BallaBodyPowder.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS)

**Balla** Body Powder, *Value $6*

I've received this before in another subscription box so I know that this is a good product.

<br>

[![Gentleman's Box July 2016 Coupons](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJuly2016Coupons.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS)

**Various Coupons**

A few coupons were also included in this month's box which includes an exclusive coupon for **Debonaire Scent** First Month Free! Debonaire Scent is a monthly cologne discovery box. Every month you'll receive three different colognes that's matched to your scent profile from hundreds of designer and niche brands for only $15/month. So this coupon alone is worth $15! I'm totally going to try them out!

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** Super loving this month's items! I feel like I've been receiving way too many ties lately so I appreciate that this month they decided to send a couple of accessory items instead, the leather shoe horn and wallet. And on top of that I'm introduced to a new subscription by way of a coupon for my first month free, so excited about that as well. I love trying out new subs! [Gentleman's Box](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"} continues to send out a great box month after month.
