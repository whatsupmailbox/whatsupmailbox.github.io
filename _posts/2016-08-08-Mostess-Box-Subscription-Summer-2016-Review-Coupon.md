<br>

I've been wanting to try out this subscription for awhile and when they came out with a spoiler of an item that caught my eye (more on that later), I immediately subscribed!

I love hosting friends over to our house, be it a small gathering or big, and I try hard to be the hostess with the mostess. So this box naturally had its appeal to me but because it was fairly new (launched earlier this year), I wanted to monitor it for a bit before actually subscribing.

So here goes the review! 

<br>

![Mostess Box Summer 2016 Package](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/Mostess-Box-Summer-2016-Package.jpg)

They ship their boxes inside this unmarked brown box. Makes it safe from prying eyes and nosy neighbours!

<br>

![Mostess Box Summer 2016 Package](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/Mostess-Box-Summer-2016-Open-Package.jpg)

Once you open the brown box, you finally see the Mostess Box, all wrapped up in white ribbon.

<br>

![Mostess Box Summer 2016 Package](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/Mostess-Box-Summer-2016-Box.jpg)

The box is gorgeous and big, I love how they include a white ribbon around it, it adds that extra tr√®s chic look!

<br>

![Mostess Box Summer 2016 Package](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/Mostess-Box-Summer-2016-Open-Box-02.jpg)

The packaging inside includes a lot of stuffing to prevent much movement during shipment.

<br>

**The Info Booklet:**

![Mostess Box Summer 2016 Package](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/Mostess-Box-Summer-2016-Info-Booklet.jpg)

With every box they include an info booklet detailing the items that were curated for this box and why it was chosen.

I love the booklet, it's so well made and informational!

<br>

![Mostess Box Summer 2016 Package](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/Mostess-Box-Summer-2016-Pineapple-Co-Shot-Glasses.jpg)

**The Pineapple Co.** Pineapple Shot Glasses, *Value $35*

<br>

These pineapples are all the rage right now! They actually revealed this item prior and since I have them in the tumbler size, I just had to have the matching shot glasses. They will look amazing together as a set! As you can see from the picture, you can take the pineapple crown from the top and use it as a base stand for the actual shot glass. 

Although I don't drink shots that often, I do drink some cordials from time to time and this will be great for that. Besides the obvious use as a gorgeous decoration of course. Can't wait to display this!

<br>

![Mostess Box Summer 2016 Package](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/Mostess-Box-Summer-2016-Signature-Summer-Table-Runner.jpg)

**Mostess Signature Summer Table Runner** *Value $25?*

I couldn't really find a value so I'm estimating based on other similar runners.

<br>

![Mostess Box Summer 2016 Package](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/Mostess-Box-Summer-2016-Signature-Summer-Table-Runner-02.jpg)

Table runners are such an easy and great way to dress up your table! This design is simple yet classic, it will surely fit with a lot of colors and themes.

<br>

![Mostess Box Summer 2016 Package](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/Mostess-Box-Summer-2016-Rosanna-Patio-Party-Flamingo-Plates-03.jpg)

**Rosanna Patio Party Flamingo Plates** (set of 4), *Value $60*

<br>

Oh how I love the Rosanna brand, I literally collect them and can't get enough of them. I mean who can say no to such pretty designs, and this one is certainly one of them! The colors are perfect and the size of the plate is meant for appetizers and deserts. It says handwash only, which is totally fine with me. I would not let something so pretty and precious be handled by a machine =)

<br>

![Mostess Box Summer 2016 Package](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/Mostess-Box-Summer-2016-Sunnylife-Flamingo-Forks-02.jpg)

**Sunnylife** Flamingo Forks (set of 24), *Value $7*

<br>

Matching forks for the plates! Sunnylife is another brand that's trending this summer. Both in retail and in subscription boxes. It's been featured in [Popsugar](http://popsugar-must-have.evyy.net/c/164125/137737/2706){:target="_blank"} boxes in the past, and last month recently. They make those infamous swan floats among other designs and I am guilty of having a few of them myself.

These forks can be used to dress up your cocktails and pick up fruits, olives, or small appetizers. So cute!

<br>

![Mostess Box Summer 2016 Package](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/Mostess-Box-Summer-2016-Old-Kentucky-Home-Acacia-Wood-Muddler-02.jpg)

**Old Kentucky Home Acacia Muddler**, *Value $9.99*

This muddler is made from Beechwood and comes with a storage bag. We drink a lot of mojitos and muddled cocktails in our house so this is an item that will surely be used for many years. It says you can also use it to make guacamole which is new to me, I've been using a mortar and pestle to make those but I can surely try with a wooden muddler and see how that goes.

<br>

![Mostess Box Summer 2016 Package](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/Mostess-Box-Summer-2016-Blank-Slate-Kitchen-Palm-Sugar-Syrup-Jacobsen-Salt-Co-Guacamole-Seasoning.jpg)

**Jacobsen Salt Co.** Guacamole Seasoning, *Value $9*

This seasoning allows you to make guacamole in a jiffy! Just add avocados and lime juice, muddle them together and voila, guacamole. I love easy cooking, thanks Mostess, you get me.

<br>

**Blank Slate Kitchen** Palm Sugar Simple Syrup, *Value $13.99*

Ah, simple syrup, a must have basic ingredient for making cocktails. Or you can also use it to replace sugar if needed. A few recipes were also included in the box that uses this syrup, you can see the pics below.

<br>

![Mostess Box Summer 2016 Package](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/Mostess-Box-Summer-2016-Beverage-Recipes.jpg)

The Palm Mojito sounds yummy and I think I'll be making that as soon as I'm done with this review =P

<br>

And food recipes were included as well:

![Mostess Box Summer 2016 Package](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/Mostess-Box-Summer-2016-Recipes.jpg)

All of this is making me hungry! I may just have to host myself today so I can make use of everything asap. I think I shall, lol.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** My first box from Mostess and it's amazing, I am super happy with their Summer 2016 curation! All the items were totally me and truly fit my style as a hostess. It definitely felt very summery and yet still elegant and high quality. And not only will these items be great for myself, they are all items that can be gifted too. I am impressed with my first box from Mostess and am excited to find out what they have in store for Fall!
