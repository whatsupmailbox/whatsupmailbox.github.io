<p>When you subscribe, you'll take a profile survey to input your size and style preferences. My husband selected "Fashion Forward" as his style with a preference in vibrant rich colors. There are 4 options in style; Classic, Casual, Fashion Forward or a Mix of all.</p>

<br>

<p>This month's items are part of an exclusive collaboration. Five Four Club partnered with esteemed designer Robert Geller to craft a collection that’s timeless, modern, and sure to complement any member’s wardrobe. Robert Geller took inspiration from the mysterious and effortlessly cool style icons of the fifties. This collection is a reflection of that - a modern take on Old Hollywood style.</p>  

<br>

<H4>Based on my husband's "Fashion Forward" profile, here is what they sent:</H4>

<p>I always love it when Five Four Club sends me jackets. My husband and I are going on a trip to Europe this week so this will surely be a great outerwear for him while we're there.</p>

<p>A closer look at the collar area shows the exclusive collaboration branding as well as a snap tab closure to secure the zipper.</p>

<p>More button details on the side pockets and I love that it's gold. I'd like to think it represents Hollywood, so a little pop of gold on this jacket makes it uber cool.</p>

<br>

<p>Here's a picture of the jacket on a model from their website:</p>

<p>So happy I received this jacket and I love how versatile it is. My husband can definitely wear it casually or even dress it up a little for date nights. Love it!</p>

<p>I love the two tone color on this shirt and taupe is another versatile color that will go with pretty much anything; jeans, khakis, or even shorts.</p>

<p>The collaboration branding is shown at the bottom left of this shirt. Small yet pertinent.</p>

<p>I love the tags that come with this month's collaboration items. They look classy and totally high fashion label!</p>

<p>And here's a look at the shirt on a model from their website:</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> So happy with this month's items, totally my husband's style and fashion forward indeed. My husband would have picked these items himself if he went out shopping so that's a definite good sign. And on top of that, this month's items were a collaboration with Robert Geller, a men's high fashion designer focusing in modern and innovative style. T-Shirts from his own brand alone costs upwards of $100! So at $60, these 2 items more than make up the cost.</p>

<p>If you haven't subscribed yet, you can <a href="https://www.fivefourclub.com/getstarted?referrer=RE731318" target="_blank">get $15 off your first package through this link</a>. That brings the cost down to $45 for 2-3 fashion items!</p>
