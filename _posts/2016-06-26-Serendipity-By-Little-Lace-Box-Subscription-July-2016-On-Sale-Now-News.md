<center><H4>July Serendipity by LLB is available today!</H4>

<br>

<p>They are now offering two subscription options:</p>

<br>

<center><a target="_blank" href="http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=828416&amp;u=1115177&amp;m=61975&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack="><img src="http://static.shareasale.com/image/61975/serendipity_logo-annualwording.jpg" border="0" /></a></center>
<p>A prepaid Annual subscription (six boxes sent over 12 months) for $59.94 ($9.99 per box). None of the pre-paid subscriptions (LLB or Serendipity) auto-renew, so you may receive a "cancellation" email after making this purchase. This cancellation email is what occurs when the auto-renew is turned off, it's just their system that does this so you can disregard that email.</p>

<br>

<p>A NEW price on their bi-monthly Serendipity subscription that will auto-renew on a bi-monthly basis. This subscription is now $12.99. This new bi-monthly Serendipity subscription can be canceled at any time by sending an email to info@littlelacebox.com These are the only two Serendipity products that are currently offered. They have eliminated the single-month Serendipity.</p>

<br>

<p>Get your <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=782083&u=1115177&m=61975&urllink=&afftrack=">Serendipity box</a> now before it gets sold out! The openings to subscribe to this box are limited to quantity so it'll close as soon as it's sold out, and trust me, it gets sold out quick! You can <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=782083&u=1115177&m=61975&urllink=&afftrack=">subscribe here</a> to receive their July box. This sub is one of my favorites boxes to subscribe to because you get so much for so little!</p>
