[Emma & Chloe](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"} is a French jewelry subscription box that ships 1 jewelry item every month that's made in France. They initially only shipped to Europe but started shipping to U.S. this year (so happy when that happened!). And since I love everything French, I subscribed in a heartbeat!

When you first subscribe, you'll be prompted to answer a couple of questions regarding your jewelry preferences such as silver or gold, and pin or clip earrings. And as a bonus for being a subscriber, you'll also receive 20% discount on anything in their online shop!

<br>

Emma & Chloe ships their jewelry items in this cute and unique box. I've been collecting every single one that I own to store the actual jewelry inside and display them like a book on an actual bookcase. It's such a great display!

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Open Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaEtChloeSeptember2016OpenBox.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}
 
The box opens up like a book and inside you see their jewelry bag as well as their info magazine, "La Gazette".

<br>

**The Info Magazine, La Gazette:**

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaEtChloeSeptember2016InfoMagazine.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}

Their Info Magazine is quite thick and full of useful details as you'll see in the pics below.

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaEtChloeSeptember2016InfoMagazine02.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}

Inside you'll fine a section about the designer of this month's jewelry, and a Q & A about her inspiration and background.

You'll also find a travel section and guide of touring Paris in two days!

[Emma & Chloe](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"} sends their monthly jewelry pieces in these black drawstring bags. It's very handy when you need to travel as they will keep your jewels safe and organized.

<br>

<H4>And here is this month's jewelry item:</H4>

[![Emma & Chloe September 2016 Item - May & June Tumen Bracelet in Gold](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaEtChloeSeptember2016MayAndJuneTumenBraceletGold.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}

**May & June** Tumen Bracelet in Gold, *Value $60*

Subscribers will receive this bracelet in either Silver or Gold, depending on your jewelry preferences. I received gold because I wear it most often when compared to silver.

You can see both designs in the info magazine as shown below.

When you complete your jewelry preferences, you can of course select gold or silver, or you can also have them surprise you every month if you wear both metals and don't really have a preference.

The bracelet has these two leather leaf shapes as pendants. One is yellow and the other is gold.

On the other end is a small gold disc with the brand logo, "May & June".

<br>

And here's how it looks on me:

This bracelet is delicate and minimal yet still feminine. Although you can of course wear this layered with other pieces, I think wearing it alone makes the unique draping chain on this bracelet stand out. I really like this!

<br>

**Certificate of Authenticity:**

They also include a "Certificate of Authenticity" with every jewelry item, so you know it's 100% authentic, gorgeous and precious too!

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** It's always a treat to receive my Emma & Chloe boxes every month, it's like I'm getting a present directly from France! And I know I won't be able to find any of the items here in the US which makes it extra special. Although I'm more of a statement jewelry type of gal, I also have a soft spot for delicate designs and this one definitely counts. I love how it looks on, and the draping part of this bracelet is quite unique and different than what I have, so I'm totally happy to add this to my jewelry collection. Plus the two leaves is so appropriate for this fall season! I'm sure I'll be wearing this all season long.
