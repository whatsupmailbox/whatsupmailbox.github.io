[Bespoke Post](http://bespoke.evyy.net/c/164125/70438/1804){:target="_blank"} is one of those subscription boxes that feels like a great curated gift box to me. I mostly gift it to myself (guilty), but it's also a great gift to give to someone else as well. And since they come up with so many different themes, there's always something for everyone. Plus you get way more than what you pay for.

First look at unboxing shows their info sheet describing the items inside.

The items inside are packaged neatly and safely with bubble wrap on the ones that are extra fragile.

**The Info Sheet:**

Their info sheet is more like a guidebook on how to use all the items in your box. It's always fun and helpful reading it.

The back of the info sheet has some interesting booze facts. I always wanted to know what the difference is between white and dark rum. I must be a newbie.

<H4>And here are the items inside the box:</H4>

**Pineapple Co.** Pineapple Tumblers, Set of 2, 12 oz. *Value $70 ($35/each)*

I've seen these tumblers before (last year I think) and I thought to myself, I gotta have one of those! I mean look at them, they're so gorgeous and you can use the bottom of the pineapple as a stand. So cool! But as usual, it got put away in the back of my to do list and I forgot about purchasing them. Now that Pineapples are so in this summer, plus I saw that [Bespoke Post](http://bespoke.evyy.net/c/164125/70438/1804){:target="_blank"} had a box that included these this month, it was a done deal. I clicked and I bought.

The tumblers were packaged in this simple yet modern packaging. I love their logo, so darn stinkin cute!

This is how it looks like when you separate the bottom part and the top. The inside is the same material as the outside and it is just gorgeously golden.

The drinking vessel itself is just the right size for you to hold, not too big or small. And the ridges help to hold a grip on them because metal can be slippery when wet, which will happen when you put ice cold drinks in it.

Their Pineapple logo is also imprinted at the bottom of the tumbler. I love that it's just their logo with no wordings on it. So simple, so pretty, aaahhh, it's just so darn gorgeous! I love these and I can't wait to show them off in my next party!

[![Liber & Co. Tropical Passion Fruit Syrup](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/BespokePostIslandBoxJuly2016LiberCoTropicalPassionFruitSyrup.jpg)](http://bespoke.evyy.net/c/164125/70438/1804){:target="_blank"}

**Liber & Co.** Tropical Passion Fruit Syrup, 8.5 fl oz. *Value $10*

Being born and raised in a tropical place, passion fruit has always been one of my favorite fruits. I love the sweet and exotic taste it brings so I was super happy that they included this syrup. I can't wait to make some martinis or margaritas with this, it's gonna taste amazing!

[![Bespoke Post Custom Tropical Coasters](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/BespokePostIslandBoxJuly2016CustomTropicalCoasters.jpg)](http://bespoke.evyy.net/c/164125/70438/1804){:target="_blank"}

**Bespoke Post** Custom Tropical Coasters, Set of 2.

Of course they had to include a set of coasters, it just wouldn't be right if they didn't. It's the perfect addition and the perfect design too!

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** This has got to be one of my favorite boxes from them! I absolutely LOVED everything! The pineapple tumblers are the hero items of course, but the inclusion of the passion fruit syrup and the tropical coasters just made it even more perfect. Plus it's such a good deal, the tumblers themselves are sold for $35 each, and you get 2 with this box so it's an amazing deal. It's almost like a buy one get one free if you count the syrup price into it. I am just super happy that they curated this box, thank you [Bespoke Post](http://bespoke.evyy.net/c/164125/70438/1804){:target="_blank"}, you definitely made my summer boozy with happiness!
