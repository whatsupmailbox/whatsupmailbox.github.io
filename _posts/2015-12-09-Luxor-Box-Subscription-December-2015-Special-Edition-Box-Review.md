<p><b>The Box:</b> <a href="http://www.luxorbox.com/#!become-a-member/cjg9" target="_blank">Luxor Box December 2015 Special Edition Box</a></p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $175 to the US, $195 to Canada + Free shipping.</p>
<p><b>What's in the box:</b> 6 unique luxurious gifts that have a total value of $500+!</p>

<p>When I heard that this Special Edition box would include a 1951 Maison Francaise clutch, I immediately went online and purchased one, no joke</p>

<p>They offered different clutches to choose from to be included in the box:</p>

<p>I chose the Tigre pattern since I wanted something less conservative ;)</p>
<br>

<p>So let's get on to unboxing this beauty!</p>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxDecember2015SpecialEditionPackage.jpg"></center>
<p>They shipped with their typical white boxes that they use for their subscription boxes. White and unmarked, making it safe from prying eyes.</p>
<br>

<p>The box is nicely tucked inside and arrives in perfect condition.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>1951 Maison Fran√ßaise</b> Large Clutch in Tigre</DT>
<DD>Value $90</DD>
</DL>

<p>This clutch is made with leather, cowhide and brass materials. You can attach the gold chain to use it as a crossbody, or use without as a clutch.</p>

<p>Note that this is the Large size which is smaller than the ones that were in the Oui Please box, those were XL size. It measures approx.</p>
<br>

<p>Inside you can see their trademark red lining with white dots, and of course the 1951 branding.</p>
<p>I am in love with my clutch and can't wait to wear it!</p>

<DT><b>Jules Smith</b> Ari Lariat Necklace</DT>
<DD>Value $45</DD>
</DL>

<p>This silver necklace is interesting to say the least. It's long with elongated pave pendants, and the strands are adjustable so it allows you to choose the length of the pendant drop.</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxDecember2015SpecialEdition.jpg"></center>
<figcaption>A closer look at the pendant</figcaption>

<br>

<p>Although I do love pave necklaces, the lariat style just isn't for me. Plus I'm more of a gold person, so sadly this will be gifted.</p>

<br>

<DL>
<DT><b>Mary Jurek</b> Fidelia Square Bowl</DT>
<DD>Value $50</DD>
</DL>

<p>What a great item to receive for the upcoming holidays. I love beautiful serving pieces and this is just that. It's simple yet oozes luxury with its shiny silver finish. Just gorgeous.</p>
<br>

<figcaption>A look at the bowl from above</figcaption>

<br>

<p>You can see the square shape from above more clearly. This bowl actually comes in 4 different sizes, the one subscribers received is the 5" bowl. Knowing that, I may want to purchase the other sizes. Who am I kidding, I NEED to purchase the other sizes, pronto!</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Mary Jurek</b> Holiday Heart Ornament</DT>
<DD>Value $25</DD>
</DL>

<p>Subscribers received either this Heart design, a 6-point Star or a Dove. I'm sooo thankful I got the Heart, it makes it more versatile as I can use this not just for the Christmas holidays, but Valentines, Birthdays, pretty much anything, yay!</p>

<p>And not only is it a beautiful and quality ornament, it also comes with its own silk string and micro-suede pouch, how thoughtful!</p>

<br>

<DL>
<DT><b>Painted Earth</b> Vitamin C Eye Treatment</DT>
<DD>Value $32.50</DD>
</DL>

<p>This Vitamin C enriched eye gel will reduce puffiness, sagging skin, under eye circles, wrinkles and crow's feet. It's oil-free, easy to apply and will help soothe and refresh the area around your eyes.</p>

<br>

<DL>
<DT><b>Painted Earth</b> Optimum 15% Vitamin C Face Wash</DT>
<DD>Value $27</DD>
</DL>

<p>I always love a good face wash so I was happy to see this item in the box and I especially appreciate the pump dispenser, makes it so convenient to use and dispense on my Clarisonic brush.</p>

<p>This face wash will help reduce your sun spots and discoloration, as well as refine skin texture and reduce wrinkles. It's sulfate-free and gentle enough to use daily, but just be sure to put on sunscreen during the day if you use this. Any product that reduces sun spots or discoloration, if used during the day should be accompanied with sunscreen or else your spots will just get darker, and we sure don't want that.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This is such a great Special Edition box, well done Luxor Box! I absolutely love every single item and it truly does feel luxurious, I think they did a great job in curating it and it's definitely worth the price. I'm so glad I splurged and got this box!</p>
