<p>When you subscribe, you'll take a profile survey to input your size and style preferences. My husband selected "Fashion Forward" as his style with a preference in vibrant rich colors. There are 4 options in style; Classic, Casual, Fashion Forward or a Mix of all.</p>

<H4>Based on my husband's "Fashion Forward" profile, here is what they sent:</H4>

<p>It's always a great month when Five Four Club decides to send a jacket! This jacket is cool in every way, from the color to the style. It's something my husband doesn't have yet and will totally wear.</p>

<p>A closer look at the collar area shows a different lining inside with a red and blue checkered pattern.</p>

<p>You can close this jacket up with a zipper or button, or both. I love that! This is surely a great jacket to send out and my husband can't wait to wear it!</p>

<p>This tee is soft and a great basic style and color to have for any season. The color of the sleeves are different, it's a light grey color, giving this tee a pop of color and a bit of modern style.</p>

<p>This tee will go great with the olive jacket, which is what my husband will be layering this with.</p>

<p>Another tee that's soft to the touch! This one is also a great addition to my husband's wardrobe as it's basic yet with a slight touch of modern. You can see that the sleeves and the bottom opening of the shirt has a second layer with additional material in light grey.</p>

<p>My husband loves simple styles that have a twist or additional uniqueness to it, and this certainly says all that.</p>

<p>A closer look at the collar area shows a different lining, and the black tee actually has some specks of multi-color in them.</p>
