This is the second time I get to review this subscription box and knowing what I got last month ([you can read that review here](http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Cate-And-Chloe-VIP-Jewelry-Subscription-Box-July-2016-Review-Coupon/){:target="_blank"}) which was great, I'm excited to see what this month brings!

<b>This review is for the Full VIP Status box.</b>

<br>

[![First look at unboxing](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016OpenBox.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

First look at unboxing reveals their pretty tissue paper packaging and their info card stating "Hello, VIP", that's me!

<br>

The Info Card:

On the back of the card you'll find details of the jewelry you received. I see that I received all matching items, yay!

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe VIP August 2016 Jewelry Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016JewelryBox.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

Cate & Chloe sends their jewelry items in these cute boxes. It definitely makes a difference to find your jewelry packaged in cute and reusable boxes versus a cheap and regular plastic packaging.

<br>

<H4>And here are my items for this month:</H4>

[![Cate & Chloe VIP August 2016 Items](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016Items.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

[![Cate & Chloe Ashlyn Nature Double Strand Leaf Necklace](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016AshlynNatureDoubleStrandLeafNecklace.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

**Ashlyn "Nature" Double Strand Leaf Necklace**, *Value $89*

*Size: Short chain = 18", Long chain = 20", Extender = 3"*

<br>

I can never have enough necklaces. The leaf design of the pendant is perfect for summer and even fall. And what's more is that this exact necklace is celebrity Jenny McCarthy's favorite style! You can even see her wearing it on the [Cate & Chloe website](https://cateandchloe.com/products/ashlyn-nature-double-strand-leaf-necklace){:target="_blank"}.

<br>

Here's a full view of the necklace:

[![Cate & Chloe Ashlyn Nature Double Strand Leaf Necklace](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016AshlynNatureDoubleStrandLeafNecklace2.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

I love how it's set off-center with the double strand on one side and a single strand on the other, and then topped off with a single pearl above the leaf.
 
<br>

And here it is on me:

[![Cate & Chloe Ashlyn Nature Double Strand Leaf Necklace](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016AshlynNatureDoubleStrandLeafNecklace3.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

I can totally wear this for both work days and casual weekends. The length is perfect, not too long and not too short. FYI, I wore the necklace at its maximum length for the picture.

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe Ashlyn Nature Pearl Leaf Earrings](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016AshlynNaturePearlLeafEarrings.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

**Ashlyn "Nature" Pearl Leaf Earrings**, *Value $79*

<br>

The matching earrings are exactly like the pendant on the necklace. I'm thinking of tropical vibes now and it would be perfect to wear for an island getaway.

<br>

Here's a closer look at the earrings:

[![Cate & Chloe Ashlyn Nature Pearl Leaf Earrings](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016AshlynNaturePearlLeafEarrings2.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

These earrings are just as pretty as the necklace and you can use this together or separately.

<br>

And here they are on me:

[![Cate & Chloe Ashlyn Nature Pearl Leaf Earrings](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016AshlynNaturePearlLeafEarrings3.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

The size of these earrings are just right and the pearl adds a touch of class and texture to the style. It's also very lightweight so for those of you who don't like to wear heavy earrings, rejoice!

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe Ashlyn Infinity Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016AshlynInfinityBracelet.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

**Ashlyn Infinity Bracelet**, *Value $79*

*Size: 7" with 1.5" extender*

<br>

Although this bracelet is an Ashlyn style, it has the infinity design versus the leaf. I think if they gave me the leaf design it may be just a tad bit too much of matching items, so I'm glad they went ahead and sent me a different style.

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe Ashlyn Infinity Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016AshlynInfinityBracelet2.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

It still has the pearl inclusion so it still goes well together with the other two pieces. I love infinity symbols on my jewelry because it represents endless love and friendship which are two things you need in life.

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe Ashlyn Infinity Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016AshlynInfinityBracelet3.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

I like how delicate the strands are and yet the size of the pendant is substantial so it can stand out and make a statement. It will also layer well with other bracelets and would make a perfect gift for your BFF too.

<br>

<H4>Bonus Item:</H4>

[![Cate & Chloe VIP August 2016 Bonus Item](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016VioletLoveHeadband.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

**Violet Love** Headband in LENA print. *Value $19*

*Note: Subscribers received various prints.*

<br>

This month's bonus item is a headband by [Violet Love](http://violetloveheadbands.com){:target="_blank"}. I really like the pattern I got, and it's actually from their Black Label line which means it's "slightly thicker and more absorbant fabric with a tighter stretch than our Signature line."

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe VIP August 2016 Bonus Item](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016VioletLoveHeadband2.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

It came packaged with their info and it states that this headband is soft, ultra comfortable, won't give you headaches, and won't slip either. And it's also Made in LA!

I actually hate wearing headbands because it does give me headaches most of the time so I'm definitely going to test this headband out and see if it delivers what it promises. If it does, I'll be using the 50% coupon to buy some more!

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** I think I love this set more than what I received last month! It's always fun to try new jewelry styles and I certainly don't have one with leaf pendants so this was such a treat! Plus all 3 items matched and look well paired together. The bonus headband was also a great new brand discovery, I never knew a headband could be so buttery soft. This subscription is definitely one to try if you're a jewelry lover like myself, and you definitely get more than what you pay for.
