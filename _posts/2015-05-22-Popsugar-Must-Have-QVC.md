<p><a href="http://popsu.gr/vdrb"><b>Popsugar Must Have</b></a> is teaming up with QVC for the first time ever to curate a box that will incorporate brands from them.</p>

<p>There's no additional info they've provided so far, and I'm curious to know if they'll release any spoilers at all.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://popsu.gr/vdrb">Popsugar Must Have QVC box</a> will be available for purchase only through QVC and <a href="www.qvc.com">QVC.com</a> starting on May 29th.</p> 

<p>From past experiences, special edition boxes by <a href="http://popsu.gr/vdrb">Popsugar</a> always sells fast, so if you're interested, be ready to purchase that day!</p>
