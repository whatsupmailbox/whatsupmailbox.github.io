![Gentleman's Box June 2016 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJune2016Box.jpg)

**Subscription:** [Gentleman's Box](https://gentlemansbox.com"){:target="_blank"}

**Cost:** $25/monthly + Free Shipping to USA. $8 shipping to Canada.

**What's in the box:** Four to six hand-selected products for men, accompanied by the latest issue of GQ Magazine (U.S. and Canada only).

*Note: The GQ magazine that's included with the subscription used to be shipped together in the box, but now it comes separately in the mail.*

<br>

Men's subscription boxes are quite few to find so I love it when I get the opportunity to review one. It's such a treat!

<br>

<H4>This month's box title is “Our Favorite Fashion Mogul” Box</H4>

<br>


![Open Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJuly2016OpenBox.jpg)

I love the uplifting words that are printed on the inside cover, Look Good - Feel Good - Be Good!

<br>

<br>

This month includes a couple of boxed items, interesting, can't wait to see what they are!

<br>

<p><b>Info Magazine:</b></p>

<center>*Table of Contents*</center>

The info magazine that they include with every box are so very useful. It details each item in the box as well as the brand/creator behind it.

<br>

They also include a section on how to wear all the items in the box all together for a super dapper look!

<br>

<H4>And here are all the items:</H4>

I'm loving the colors this month brings, bright red with vintage browns.

<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>
![Kiko Brown Leather Wallet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJuly2016KikoLeatherWallet.jpg)

**Kiko** Brown Leather Wallet, *Value $45*

<br>

I think this is the first time ever I received a leather wallet from a subscription, how awesome. The leather is soft and the brown color is vintage and classic indeed. 

<br>

The inside has 4 card slots and a long section to keep your cash organized. An all around great wallet!

<br>

![Gentlemen Essentials Leather Shoe Horn](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJuly2016GentlemenEssentialsLeatherShoeHorn.jpg)

**Gentlemen Essentials** Leather Shoe Horn, *Value $*

<br>

Leather shoe horns are a luxury to have. It beats plastic cheap looking ones that you see in typical department stores by a longshot.

<br>

![Gentlemen Essentials Leather Shoe Horn](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJuly2016GentlemenEssentialsLeatherShoeHorn2.jpg)

I like that it comes with a strap, so you can hang it somewhere so it's easy to find versus rummaging through a drawer to find it.

<br>


![William Sterling Premium No Show Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJuly2016WilliamSterlingNoShowSocks.jpg)

**William Sterling** Premium No Show Socks, *Value $*

<br>

No show socks are a must during the hot summer season. The colors on this one is perfect for July. It has red, white and blue, very patriotic indeed.

<br>

![Nikolas Ryan Pocket Square](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJuly2016NikolasRyanPocketSquare.jpg)

**Nikolas Ryan** Pocket Square, *Value $*

<br>

I am loving this pocket square. Both the design and color is so popping bright that it will certainly compliment any outfit this summer.

<br>

![Balla Body Powder](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJuly2016BallaBodyPowder.jpg)

**Balla** Body Powder, *Value $*

I've received this before in another subscription box so I know that this is a good product.

<br>

**Various Coupons**

A few coupons were also included in this month's box.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** Super loving this month's items! I feel like I've been receiving way too many ties lately so I appreciate that this month they decided to send a couple of accessory items instead, the leather shoe horn and wallet.
