Ipsy always ships their glam bags in bright neon pink padded envelopes. It stands out in your mailbox and you can't miss when it actually arives!

<br>

Ipsy is very similar to <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Birchbox</a> where all subscribers receive different variations in their bag, and is mostly dependent on the answers you give in the Ipsy beauty quiz. They try to give you products that match your needs and concerns so not everyone will get the same items. And you can retake the beauty quiz at anytime if you feel that the products didn't really match you.

This review is for my profile so it's just one of the many variations that they sent out.

This month's theme is "SideShow"

A closer look at the bag shows the zipper pull with the Ipsy branding, as well as the raised design that's on one side of the bag.

**Glamour Dolls** x Lisa Frank Angle Blush Brush. *Value $10*

I LOVE getting makeup brushes in my Ipsy glambags and this one is just adorbs! How cute are the unicorns and stars!! And the bristles are quite soft too. This will be a great and fun brush to use, I'll most likely use it to blush my cheeks and hope that some unicorn dust showers me with love everytime =)

**The White Company** Seychelles Hand & Nail Cream  
Deluxe Sample Size, 30 ml. *Value $3*

I can never have enough hand creams, they're literally scattered everywhere in my house. Every little storage and drawer will contain one. Why? Because I need them within arms reach everywhere I go, and no, I don't think I'm the only one. So... this will definitely be used, I just need to think of another nook or cranny to place this in. LOL.

**Meg** Twin Nail Polish in Lovey Dovey  
Full Size 10 ml, *Value $10*

<br>

Although I have tons of nail polishes in my collection - enough to probably open up my own nail salon - I still enjoy receiving them and have fun trying out new colors/brands. The packaging on this one is cool cause you get two-in-one kind of deal. And they both compliment each other too, in case you feel like a two tone or "every finger one color except one" type of vibe.

**Jesse's Girl** Liquid Eyeliner in Black  
Deluxe Sample Size 1 ml, *Value $2*

I gotta be honest, I'm not a big fan of this brand. I've received it in the past as a different type of makeup and was not impressed. Nope! The quality just feels cheap and when you're used to high quality makeup, this just doesn't cut it. Sorry, not sorry!

<br>

[![TONYMOLY Liptone LipCare Stick in ](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsyMarch2017NeogenCoconutMilkPureMildCleanserCakeDessertedIslandSupremeBodyMousse.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?cid=ppage_ref&sid=link&refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

**TONYMOLY** Liptone LipCare Stick in  
Full Size 3.5 g., *Value $10*

Woot woot! A lip balm that's full size, well yes please! And TONYMOLY is a brand that I'm already familiar with. It's a K-Beauty brand that used to be available in Sephora but I just found out recently that they don't carry it anymore. Not sure why. Either way, I'm happy in getting this.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This month's glambag was a mixed bag of happiness and disappointment. I loved the type of products they sent (makeup brush, lip balm, hand cream, etc), but the brands were kind of on the drugstore/cheap side, and the total value... way low than what I'm used to. It's still triple the cost of what I paid for, so I'm still happy with that. Plus I'll use 4 out of the 5 items, which is another thing to be happy about. I guess I'm just spoiled with the great brands and high value of full-sized items that I've received in the past. Can't win them all right? Now I'm off to rating each product on my online profile in the hopes that they'll match me with better items next month. Fingers crossed!
