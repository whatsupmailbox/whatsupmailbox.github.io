<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

[![Golden Rabbit Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJune2017GoldenRabbitSocks.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

**Golden Rabbit** Socks, *Value $12*

My husband can never have enough socks, especially with all the cool and vibrant styles they have these days, it's too fun to limit yourself to only a few pair!

<br>

[![Golden Rabbit Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJune2017GoldenRabbitSocks02.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

These socks are made of 70% cotton, 20% nylon, 7% polyster and 3% spandex. The coral color is also pretty vibrant and the blue stripes adds that cool dapper style that will be perfect to pair with your summer outfits.

<br>

[![Aristo Ties Neck Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJune2017AristoTiesNeckTie.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

**Aristo Ties** Neck Tie, *Value $39*

Polka dot ties are a staple for any gentleman as they are classic and will go with pretty much anything.

<br>

This navy colored tie with coral polka dots didn't seem to wow me at first, but once I displayed it against a light tan jacket, it definitely popped out and made a statement.

<br>

[![Gentlemen Essentials Pocket Square](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJune2017GentlemenEssentialsPocketSquare.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

**Gentlemen Essentials** Pocket Square, *Value $12*

I actually have this exact pocket square already that was sent from another subscription box, and I'm super happy to have another one! Although it might look plain, it's actually super versatile and has become one of my husband's favorite pocket squares. He wears it with literally e-ve-ry-thing. Trust me, you'll find yourself reaching for this everytime you're finishing up your outfit. 

<br>

[![Defined Men](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJune2017DefinedMenLeatherWatch.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

[![Defined Men](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJune2017DefinedMenLeatherWatch02.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

**Defined Men** Leather Watch, *Value $55*

OMG, a leather watch, YES!!! Love the brown leather and the white dial face, it's the perfect combination for your summer wear and the gold ties it all together clasically.

<br>

Here's a closer look at the watch face:

[![Defined Men](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJune2017DefinedMenLeatherWatch03.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

Don't you just love the simple and minimalistic style of this face? It's totally my husband's style and he can't wait to wear it!

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** What an awesome summer box! It was definitely a grand slam and they totally delivered! Although the number of items are less this month, but considering one of them is a watch, that totally makes up for it in value and in use! I'd rather have one higher value item than two lower items that I probably have a dozen of already, so way to go Gentleman's Box! You totally hit the ball out of the park this month!
