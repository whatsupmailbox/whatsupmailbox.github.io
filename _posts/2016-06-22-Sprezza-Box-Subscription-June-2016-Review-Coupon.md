<figcaption>The Info Card</figcaption>

<br>

The June 2016 box is titled <big>The Madison</big>. Sprezza Box is located in NYC so their boxes have been titled after areas within New York lately. If you haven't guessed it already, this one is named after Madison Square Park.

<br>

<H4>Items in Detail:</H4>

[![Bedford & Broome Pocket Square](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxJune2016BedfordAndBroomePocketSquare.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Bedford & Broome** Pocket Square, *Value $18*

This pocket square has a star pattern all over. It's a collaboration between Bedford & Broome with Sprezza's design team especially for the upcoming holiday. It definitely screams Independance Day to me and this will totally be worn on July 4th!

<br>

[![Taft Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxJune2016TaftSocks.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Taft** Socks, *Value $14*

These no-show socks are just what one needs during the summer. They're soft and fits snug so that it doesn't slip off when you're walking. Great to wear with loafers which is exactly what my husband will be doing.

<br>

[![Mosaic Menswear Neck Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxJune2016MosaicMenswearNeckTie.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Mosaic Menswear** Neck Tie, *Value $35*

For some reason this necktie reminds me of a picnic basket lining, which perfectly goes well for any summer outdoor event. Not to mention, it also goes well with their Madison Square Park theme. The color is happily bright and the material is made of a soft Summer-weight cotton so it's seasonally appropriate.

<br>

Here's a look at the back of the tie:

I don't think my husband has a yellow tie yet in his collection and the pattern on this one will just brighten up any outfit. Great item to include for the summer!

<br>

[![Steel Cigar Cutter](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxJune2016SteelCigarCutter.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Steel** Cigar Cutter, *Value $15*

Oooh, a cigar cutter! Although my husband doesn't smoke cigars that often, when he does (socially), he can always count on one of his friends to have this tool handy. But now he doesn't have to, he has one of his own! A cigar in the park might just be in order soon.

</a></center>

**Sprezza** Lapel Pin, *Value $15*

Lapel pins are one of those accessories that's still quite new to my husband, but nevertheless is still an important accessory to incorporate to your outfit for that supper dapperness result. This fleur-de-lis lapel pin will surely do that. Maybe we'll get to finally attend Mardi Gras next year and use this. Or perhaps a trip to France? Parlez-vous fran√ßaise?

<br>

[![The Laundress Wash & Stain Bar](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxJune2016TheLaundressWashAndStainBar.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**The Laundress** Wash & Stain Bar, *Value $6*

The Laundress is an NYC based company and I've tried their fabric freshener before thanks to another subscription box and loved it. This bar is meant to be used for stains in areas such as the ring around your collar or those dreaded armpit stains. And on top of all that, it smells amazing too!

</a></center>

Made in USA, Animal Cruelty Free, smells amazing, travel-friendly, need I say more?

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** This month's items fit perfect for a summer day in the park theme. Definitely a couple of items that were a great discovery (the cigar cutter and the wash & stain bar), and the bright yellow color represent the summer season to the tee. The total value this month came up to 103, and although it's less than [last month's box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Sprezza-Box-Subscription-May-2016-Review-Coupon/){:target="_blank"}, it's still quadruple the cost so that's a total win still. Can't wait to wear the star patterned pocket square for July 4th. I can't believe it's just around the corner, time surely flies!
