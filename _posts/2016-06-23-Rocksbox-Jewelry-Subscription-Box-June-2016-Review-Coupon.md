## Items in detail:


[![House of Harlow 1960 Peak to Peak Fringe Earrings Gold](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/RocksboxJune2016HouseOfHarlow1960PeakToPeakFringeEarringsGold.jpg)](https://www.houseofharlow1960.com/peak-to-peak-fringe-earrings/118354-657326){:target="_blank"}

**House of Harlow 1960** Peak to Peak Fringe Earrings  
Retail $58, *Price to keep $46*

I had a crush on these earrings when I saw it posted on their Instagram, I knew I just had to have them. So I sent a request to see if they can send it to me and I'm so happy that they did! This boho, vintage style of dangly earrings are so on point with my summer style. So it was a no brainer to keep them.  
**Verdict: Keep!**

<br>

[![Kendra Scott Eleanor Ivory Mother Of Pearl Necklace Gold](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/RocksboxJune2016KendraScottEleanorIvoryMotherOfPearlNecklaceGold.jpg)](http://www.kendrascott.com/eleanor-necklace-in-ivory-pearl.html){:target="_blank"}

**Kendra Scott** Eleanor Necklace in Ivory Mother of Pearl  
Retail $65, *Price to keep $52*

Another hit piece for me! I'm a major fan of Kendra Scott (aren't we all?!) and I communicated that to them so they try their best to send her pieces as much as possible. This delicate necklace comprises of a simple bar that's made of mother of pearl framed in a minimalist 14K gold plated setting. It's an everyday piece that will surely be my go-to piece of the moment.  
**Verdict: Keep!**

<br>

[![House of Harlow Prana Double Pendant Necklace in Turquoise](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/RocksboxJune2016HouseOfHarlow1960PranaDoublePendantNecklaceTurquoise.jpg)](https://www.houseofharlow1960.com/prana-double-pendant-necklace/116939-646947){:target="_blank"}

**House of Harlow 1960** Prana Double Pendant Necklace in Turquoise  
Retail $53, *Price to keep $42*

It just keeps getting better. This layered necklace will totally match the earrings and the turquoise pendant fits perfectly for summer. I love the layered necklace look which is so in style right now. And the edgy design is totally me. I'm 3 for 3 in this shipment, yay!  
**Verdict: Keep!**

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** Best box ever!!! The past couple of boxes have been less than stellar so I haven't been posting it lately, but I decided to really communicate my likes and dislikes with their stylists (you can do this in your online account, under feedback), as well as requesting specific pieces and it seems to have worked! I am loving all my pieces this shipment and kept them all! My stylist totally listened and took my feedback into account which resulted in a perfectly matched pick for me. Either way, at $19 a month for unlimited jewelry rental and access to designer jewelry, you can't go wrong. I am now always seen with trendy and sparkling new jewelry everytime. Love this subscription!
