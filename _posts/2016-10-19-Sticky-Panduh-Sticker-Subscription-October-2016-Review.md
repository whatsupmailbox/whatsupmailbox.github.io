I'm a major sticker addict, especially when it comes to planner stickers. I subscribe to their regular Panduh Box subscription, so when they announced that a Sticky Panduh sticker subscription was launching, I subscribed in a heartbeat! Especially with the price, you really can't say no!

This is Sticky Panduh's first package and I was so curious to see what it will deliver, once it arrived in my mailbox, I couldn't help but open it right away!

The stickers are housed in a Paper Panduh folder, it's both cute, functional and it keeps the stickers in perfect shape during shipment.

**Soda Pop Studio** Planner Stickers

This month's sticker theme is fall and hello fall indeed! One sheet has half boxes and deco stickers, while the other sheet has the functional stickers; checklist, a full box, icon stickers, weekend banner, etc. Both sheets are matte and non-removable.

**Pink Sunshine Designs** Planner Stickers

Another fall woodland theme stickers. This time there's a whole sheet of full boxes which I love since I use the Erin Condren Lifeplanner Vertical layout which these boxes are perfect for! Another sheet is dedicated to deco stickers, while the last sheet on the right is functional stickers. 

All sheets are matte, except for the deco sticker sheet on the very left. Those stickers are glossy which is perfect since you won't need to write on them.

**Paper Panduh** Freebie Planner Stickers

More fox stickers with the fall theme! This sheet is also glossy and perfect to decorate your weekly schedule.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** What a nice and pleasant first package from the Sticky Panduh subscription! Although I was expecting a fall theme for the stickers, I definitely didn't think that it would all be foxes galore, lol. But still, they're cute and I will definitely use them in my planner. For the price, this is way cheaper than buying individual sticker sets on Etsy, so that's a win for me. I'm hoping the next package will bring more stickers that have the same theme throughout but not exactly the same type of stickers. Perhaps a sweater weather theme? That would be so perfect! Hint hint ;)
