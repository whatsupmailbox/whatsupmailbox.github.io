![Gentleman's Box June 2016 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJune2016Box.jpg)

**Subscription:** [Gentleman's Box](https://gentlemansbox.com" target="_blank")

**Cost:** $25/monthly + Free Shipping to USA. $8 shipping to Canada.

**What's in the box:** Four to six hand-selected products for men, accompanied by the latest issue of GQ Magazine (U.S. and Canada only).

*Note: The GQ magazine that's included with the subscription used to be shipped together in the box, but now it comes separately in the mail.*

<br>

Men's subscription boxes are quite few to find so I love it when I get the opportunity to review one. It's such a treat!

<br>

<H4>This month's box title is “Our Favorite Father Figures” Box</H4>

<br>

I love these tips that they put in the box!

<br>

<br>

You immediately see the info magazine that they include with every box on the top of the inside packaging.

![Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJune2016Info2.jpg)

The info magazine that they include with every box are so very useful. It details each item in the box as well as the brand/creator behind it.

This month I don't see the page on how to wear all the items in the box together in one outfit though, instead they include a page of dapper dads from Instagram.

<br>

<H4>And here are all the items:</H4>

It's a green theme this month, and a cool razor from Harry's!

<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>
![Something Strong Striped Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJune2016SomethingStrongStripedTie.jpg)

**Something Strong Striped Tie**, *Value $30*

<br>

This tie is made of 100% cotton and made exclusively for [Gentleman's Box](https://gentlemansbox.com" target="_blank") members. 

<br>


![Sock Fancy Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJune2016SockFancySocks.jpg)

**Sock Fancy Socks**, *Value $12*

<br>

These socks are constructed on a 200 needle count machine from quality combed cottons for comfort and quality. It also comes with a never-shrink guarantee which I will definitely put to the test.

<br>


![Harry's Razor](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJune2016HarrysRazor.jpg)

**Harry's Razor**, *Value $18*

<br>

I think this is the first time I've received a razor in a men's subscription box. My husband actually has their razor in his collection, but not this particular style. His is all stainless steel, but this one would definitely be good to travel with. Plus it comes with 4 blades to replace when needed, all you have to do is redeem the code behind the card to receive, how thoughtful!

<br>

Here's a look at the razor itself:

And here's a closer look at the razor blades:

Great item to include especially for a Father's Day month. Plus it comes in a nice box that makes it giftable too ;)

<br>

![Woodchuck USA Wooden Tie Clip](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJune2016WoodchuckUSAWoodenTieClip.jpg)

**Woodchuck USA Wooden Tie Clip**, *Value $30*

<br>

What a cool tie clip! Very industrial and rustic looking, yet still dapper. Perfect for that carpenter or outdoorsy man in you. And if you're going to an outdoor rustic theme wedding this summer, this will surely fit and make you stand out (or in?).

<br>

Here's a closer look at the tie clip:

![Woodchuck USA Wooden Tie Clip](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJune2016WoodchuckUSAWoodenTieClip3.jpg)

This is definitely a tie clip that my husband does not have yet in his collection and he will surely be using it this summer!

<br>

![LA Fresh Sunscreen Wipes](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJune2016LaFreshTravelLiteSunscreen.jpg)

**LA Fresh Sunscreen Wipes**, Bonus Item: 2 Sample Packets, *Value $*

I've tried LA Fresh foot wipes and they were great so I'm excited to try this sunscreen wipes. These wipes are SPF 30 and made with a natural formula that's neither greasy or irritating to the skin. These packets are great to bring with you to the beach or during your hikes for convenient reapplication of sunscreen.

<br>


<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** As always, Gentleman's Box delivers great and unique products that are useful too! Definitely appreciated the razor that's packaged in a nice box so it can be gifted if needed, and the wooden tie clip was really cool too. The total value came up to $90 which is pretty awesome for a $25 box.
