Popsugar Limited Edition boxes are shipped in non-marked brown boxes. This way no one knows that you have a $100 box at your front doorstep ;)

I always get excited when it's time for a Popsugar Limited Edition box. And once it arrives on my doorstep, the excitement doubles! You just know something great is inside.

<br>

You finally see the big and beautiful box inside. In the past, these limited edition boxes were black in color and this one is blue. That's something new that I believe is part of their whole new packaging.

<br>

When you open the box, you see it's wrapped with tissue paper and sealed with their logo sticker.

<br>

[![Open Box 2](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/PopsugarLimitedEditionSummer2016OpenBox2.jpg)](http://popsugar-must-have.evyy.net/c/164125/198666/2706){:target="_blank"}

Each item inside the box are individually wrapped with tissue paper and padding on some when it is needed. This ensures minimal movement during shipping plus it also looks better. I give extra points to boxes who care how their packaging looks.

I'm going crazy in love with all these items! So perfect for summer, it almost looks like a "What you need to bring to the beach" spread. So gorgeous, aaaahhhh!

<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

[![Hat Attack Beach Tote](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/PopsugarLimitedEditionSummer2016HatAttackBeachTote.jpg)](http://popsugar-must-have.evyy.net/c/164125/198666/2706){:target="_blank"}

**Hat Attack** Beach Tote, *Value $*

This tote is big! The material is like what you would find on a straw hat and it's totally perfect for the beach. I also love the simply yet summery pattern.

<br>

There's no lining inside as shown in the picture above. Maybe it's better this way, perhaps sand that makes its way inside the bag will just make its way out because of that.

<br>

[![Corkcicle Canteen](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/PopsugarLimitedEditionSummer2016CorkcicleCanteenWhite.jpg)](http://popsugar-must-have.evyy.net/c/164125/198666/2706){:target="_blank"}

**Corkcicle** Canteen in White, *Value $35*

I love any type of liquid container that can keep its temperature for a long period of time. I've been a big fan of the S'Well bottle since it first came out years ago, and now I get to try out a new brand, yay!

<br>

[![Corkcicle Canteen](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/PopsugarLimitedEditionSummer2016CorkcicleCanteenWhite2.jpg)](http://popsugar-must-have.evyy.net/c/164125/198666/2706){:target="_blank"}

This canteen bottle has a screw top and has a metal lining inside. It keeps hot liquid up to xx hours and cold up to xx hours. I love the color and holding this bottle was comfortable and non slippery as well. I can't wait to try this out with some cold white wine ;)

[![Tofino Round Beach Towel](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/PopsugarLimitedEditionSummer2016BeachTowel.jpg)](http://popsugar-must-have.evyy.net/c/164125/198666/2706){:target="_blank"}

**Tofino** Round Beach Towel, *Value $100*

How gorgeous is this beach towel! I've never had a round towel before so I'm super happy I have one now, and such a pretty one too. The round shape is great for when you're at the beach (or pretty much anywhere) laying down and need to reposition yourself (to get that perfect tan) without having to move your towel everytime.

I put the bag and canteen on it so you can see how big this towel is!

This round towel is made of 100% cotton and has a diameter of 1500 mm which roughly converts to 5 feet.

**LondonTown** Lakur Nail Polish in Royal Wedding, *Value $18*

I'm always up for some nail polishes and the color on this one is just my type. Bright, peachy and summery.
