The Info Card:

They always include an info card that lists the jewelry items inside the box.

<H4>And here are my items for this month:</H4>

<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

[![Cate & Chloe Monica Intuition 18K Gold Plated Stone Necklace](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPNovember2016MonicaIntuitionGoldPlatedStoneNecklace.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

**Monica "Intuition" 18K Gold Plated Stone Necklace**, *Value $62*

*Chain Length: 14 in. with 2 in. extender*

<br>

Stones are getting on the fashion scene more and more these days in jewelry. From marbles to natural stones, it's totally making it's way to be on-trend and in-fashion.

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe Monica Intuition 18K Gold Plated Stone Necklace](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPNovember2016MonicaIntuitionGoldPlatedStoneNecklace02.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

This necklace can surely be one of them with its 18K gold plated chain and a natural blue stone as the pendant. It looks great with sweaters and layered too. It's also not heavy to wear which sometimes stone necklaces can be.

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe Lillian Pure Geometric Earrings](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPNovember2016LillianPureGeometricEarrings.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

**Lillian "Pure" Geometric Earrings**, *Value $54*  

My info card states that I should have received studs, but I actually received these gorgeous and sparkly earrings instead. With a 3 inch drop, it definitely matches my preference of dangly earrings and those sparkle will surely be a go-to accessory for the holiday season.

I love the geometric shape as well, it adds the perfect amount of modern edge. I can totally use this for a daytime casual look or glam it up at night with that perfect little black dress.

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe Gia Gracious Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPNovember2016GiaGraciousBracelet.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

**Gia "Gracious" Bracelet**, *Value $54*

*Length: 7" with 2" extender chain*

<br>

What a pretty bracelet! I love the combination of the white stone and rhinestone, it's both versatile in matching pretty much any color and it's also fitting for the winter season.

<br>

And here's how it looks on me:

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe Gia Gracious Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPNovember2016GiaGraciousBracelet02.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

I find the style to be feminine with a touch of glam. It definitely added bling to my attire and it was also surprising light which was a major bonus for me. I thought it would have been quite heavy with all the stones and the fact that their sizes are quite significant, but nope, it's light! Love this!

<br>

<H4>Bonus Items:</H4>

[![Cate & Chloe VIP - Bliss Beauty Organic Peppermint Essential Oil](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPNovember2016BlissBeautyOrganicPeppermintEssentialOil.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

**Bliss Beauty** Organic Peppermint Essential Oil, Full Size. *Value $9.99*

I've never heard of this brand before but I'm always up for trying out new products especially one that is organic and all natural. They have a website for their products but it's all sold on Amazon just fyi.

And here's some info of the oil from their website:

"The only ingredient in our oil is organic mentha piperita oil , which offers fresh and strong mint aromas. The incredible therapeutic grade essential oil is fantastic for a wide variety of applications and uses, including muscle pain relief, sinus care, joint therapy, natural energy, hunger cravings, and much more!"

**Dr. Lipp** Nipple Balm for Lips, Sample Packet, *$bonus*

I'm actually already a fan of this amazing product. Initially created to ease nursing mothers' nipples, it has grown to have

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** This month's items are so gorgeous and totally my style. The layered necklace has now become my go-to necklace, and the earrings, I would have bought them myself if I saw it in a store. Although the ring was a bit big on me, to be fair, no one makes rings in size 3.5 so that's on me. The bonus item this month was also a great item, especially since I know the brand and am already a fan so that's a major plus. Cate & Chloe never fails to satisfy my jewelry needs, and not only are they quality made, but so on trend with the current fashion. It's always exciting to find out what they send me every month and I can't wait for next month's jewels!
