I personally love taking my vitamins in gummy form. It makes it fun to eat and I find that I end up remembering taking my daily vitamins everyday more because I look forward to it!

So when I was given the opportunity to review this subscription, I was excited and totally on board! So here it goes.

<figcaption>First look at unboxing</figcaption>

<br>

Once you unbox the outer packaging, you see a welcome message and the actual box inside.

<br>

The box has an info guide attached to it.

Here's a closer look at it:

<br>

The supplement guide lists what vitamins are included in the Essentials Pack as shown below:

Not only does it lists the type of vitamins that is included, but it also lists the amount of each of them as well.

<br>

Now let's start unboxing!

<br>

Once you unbox, you see all of these single packs inside. One for each day, how convenient!

<br>

The back side has your name, type of pack and list of vitamins that are inside the pack. I absolutely love that they did this. It's especially very helpful if you have multiple packs for other members in the household. This way you know which one is yours and avoid any confusion or conflicts for that matter! =)

These vitamins were so yummy, it was like a snack pack to treat my sweet afternoon snack attack and boy did it do the trick! Plus the packaging is oh-so convenient for me to put in my bag or even pocket so I won't forget to take my vitamins everyday!

Each type of vitamin had its own unique taste. Some were more tart, while others were sweeter in taste. I love the variety of color and taste, it really did feel like I was opening a gummy snack pack rather than a vitamin pack.

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> What a game changer! These vitamin packs are totally something that will be included in my daily routine from now on. I personally already take vitamins in gummy form, but having it packaged in these single packs totally makes a big difference. This way I remember to take all my vitamins in one sitting instead of only remembering to take one and forgetting the others because I didn't have time to reach for that extra bottle. Plus the personalized name in the back is so very helpful (not to mention, making it extra special), especially when there's multiple packs or members in the household. No confusions there. So happy that such a subscription like this exists!
