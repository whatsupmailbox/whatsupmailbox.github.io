At first I was a bit worried because the case is flat and wondered how on earth will sunglasses fit in this, but it works and it really does protect it. My husband will definitely be using this when he's traveling and doesn't want to use the typical sunglasses case that are bulky and big.

This red and blue tie has the classic diagonal stripes pattern that my husband will have no problem wearing.

The detail is very intricate and well done.

**Weekend Casual** Socks, *Value $10*

Polka dot socks! The colors match the tie and I like that they went with a different pattern for the socks.

**Niche For Men** Multi Wash, *Value $3.99*

This is an all-in-one shampoo, body wash and shave cream.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** This month had items that were very functional. Everything will surely be used and although it felt a bit lacking in the wow factor as I typically am with this box, it still had its high value. The total value of everything in this box came up to $105, which is exactly the same as last month's, but the items were definitely more up my alley then versus now. The silk tie was the definite winner in this box and made the cost totally worth it. Here's to hoping next month will bring more exciting items!
