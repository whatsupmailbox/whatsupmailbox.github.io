<DD>Value $90</DD>

<p>Details on the necklace: "100% Cotton, Woven, Embroidered w/ Resin Beads, Brass Chain, Metallic Thread & 100% Cow Hide Backing"</p>

<p>I love that this necklace came with a unique traditional Indian design jewelry pouch. It's actually quite big so you can use it for other types of storage too.</p>

<p>This necklace is so gorgeous! It's handmade in India so every piece is unique, and you can definitely see and feel the high quality.</p>

<p>Deepa Gurnani was founded by a husband and wife duo, both with Fashion and Design backgrounds. I love the design on this necklace, so blingy yet classy at the same time.</p>

<p>It's actually really comfortable wearing it since the backing is cow hide with a velvet type of material feel. It falls on your chest flat, so comfortable. It's also not very heavy (my neck says "thank you!").</p>

<p>I have some products by Becca but not this eye palette so this was a win for me! I tend to go more natural for my everyday look so I will surely be making good use of this palette. Plus it's made without Parabens, Sulfates or Phthalates, yay!</p>

<p>These shadows are infused with green coffee oil, which awakens the eyes and smooth the lids, while a built-in priming effect extends the wear of your shadow. It can also be used wet or dry as an eyeliner. I love using eyeshadows as eyeliner, it tends to last longer on my oily/combination skin versus using eye pencils alone.</p>

<p>These coasters match the Canvas Home platinum bowl that was in the Popsugar January 2015 box! They fit perfectly with my home decor and to be honest, I think they'll match any decor. Their handmade and hand-painted porcelain coasters that are glazed with platinum for that extra modern chic look. Love it!</p>

<p>Popsugar undervalued these, that's a surprise. This tray is also available in Bloomingdales and you know they only carry the good stuff ;) I love this tray, it's just like the coasters, so chic and modern! I've already put it on my work desk and put a diffuser and candle on top of it, so gorgeous!</p>
<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This box was so beautiful and elegant, I'm glad I splurged and purchased it. Definitely items I would have purchased on my own and the total value was also amazing, triple the cost! Every item was gorgeous in its own way and I love the theme of white that was incorporated here, so modern and chic. Another great special edition box by <a href="http://popsu.gr/vXrB" target="_blank">Popsugar</a>, yay!</p>

<p>This box is a one-time purchase and is no longer available, but if you want to try out there monthly edition, you can <a href="http://popsu.gr/vXrB" target="_blank"><big>subscribe here</big></a> and you'll start with their October box (September is sold out!). And you can also use coupon code <a href="http://popsu.gr/vXrB" target="_blank">MUSTHAVE5</a> to get $5 off your first box!</p>
