This is the second time I get to review this subscription box and knowing what I got last month ([you can read that review here](http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Cate-And-Chloe-VIP-Jewelry-Subscription-Box-July-2016-Review-Coupon/){:target="_blank"}) which was great, I'm excited to see what this month brings!

<br>

When you first sign up, you're invited to complete their Style Quiz so they get a better sense of your jewelry preferences and style.

First you state your metal preference and the types of jewelry you wear most often:

[![Cate & Chloe VIP Style Quiz](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateAndChloeStyleQuiz.png)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

<br>

Then you pick out the styles of jewelry that you love from a variety of choices:

[![Cate & Chloe VIP Style Quiz](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateAndChloeStyleQuiz2.png)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

This style question goes on to necklaces and earrings as well. I found this to be really helpful and promising to know that they try their best to send out jewelry items that match your style.

Now let's start unboxing!

<br>

<b>This review is for the Full VIP Status box.</b>

<br>

[![First look at unboxing](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016OpenBox.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

First look at unboxing reveals their pretty tissue paper packaging and their info card stating "Hello, VIP", that's me!

<br>

The Info Card:

On the back of the card you'll find details of the jewelry you received. I see that I received all matching items, yay!

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe VIP August 2016 Jewelry Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016JewelryBox.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

Cate & Chloe sends their jewelry items in these cute boxes. It definitely makes a difference to find your jewelry packaged in cute and reusable boxes versus a cheap and regular plastic packaging.

<br>

<H4>And here are my items for this month:</H4>

[![Cate & Chloe VIP August 2016 Items](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016Items.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

[![Cate & Chloe Ashlyn Nature Double Strand Leaf Necklace](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016AshlynNatureDoubleStrandLeafNecklace.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

**Ashlyn "Nature" Double Strand Leaf Necklace**, *Value $89*

*Size: Short chain = 18", Long chain = 20", Extender = 3"*

<br>

I can never have enough necklaces. The leaf design of the pendant is perfect for summer and even fall. And what's more is that this exact necklace is celebrity Jenny McCarthy's favorite style! You can even see her wearing it on the [Cate & Chloe website](https://cateandchloe.com/products/ashlyn-nature-double-strand-leaf-necklace){:target="_blank"}.

<br>

Here's a full view of the necklace:

[![Cate & Chloe Ashlyn Nature Double Strand Leaf Necklace](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016AshlynNatureDoubleStrandLeafNecklace2.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

I love how it's set off-center with the double strand on one side and a single strand on the other, and then topped off with a single pearl above the leaf.
 
<br>

And here it is on me:

[![Cate & Chloe Ashlyn Nature Double Strand Leaf Necklace](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016AshlynNatureDoubleStrandLeafNecklace3.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

I can totally wear this for both work days and casual weekends. The length is perfect, not too long and not too short. FYI, I wore the necklace at its maximum length for the picture.

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe Ashlyn Nature Pearl Leaf Earrings](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016AshlynNaturePearlLeafEarrings.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

**Ashlyn "Nature" Pearl Leaf Earrings**, *Value $79*

*Size: Shorter chain = 17", Longer chain = 18" with 3" extender*

<br>

The matching earrings are exactly like the pendant on the necklace. I'm thinking of tropical vibes now and it would be perfect to wear for an island getaway.

<br>

Here's a closer look at the earrings:

[![Cate & Chloe Ashlyn Nature Pearl Leaf Earrings](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016AshlynNaturePearlLeafEarrings2.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

These earrings are just as pretty as the necklace and you can use this together or separately.

<br>

And here they are on me:

[![Cate & Chloe Ashlyn Nature Pearl Leaf Earrings](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016AshlynNaturePearlLeafEarrings3.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

The size of these earrings are just right.

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe Ashlyn Infinity Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016AshlynInfinityBracelet.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

**Ashlyn Infinity Bracelet**, *Value $79*

*Size: 7" with 1.5" extender*

<br>

Although this bracelet is an Ashlyn style, it has the infinity design versus the leaf. I think if they gave me the leaf design it may be just a tad bit too much of matching items, so I'm glad they went ahead and sent me a different style.

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe Ashlyn Infinity Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016AshlynInfinityBracelet2.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

It still has the pearl inclusion so it still goes well together with the other two pieces. I love infinity symbols on my jewelry because it represents endless love and friendship which are two things you need in life.

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe Ashlyn Infinity Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016AshlynInfinityBracelet3.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

I like how delicate the strands are and yet the size of the pendant is substantial so it can stand out and make a statement. It will also layer well with other bracelets and would make a perfect gift for your BFF too.

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe VIP August 2016 Bonus Item](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateChloeVIPAug2016VioletLoveHeadband.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

All packages come with a special signature Cate & Chloe travel make up bag, and this month's bag comes with a motivational "good vibes" statement. Its simple design and pink font fits right into my style.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** My first experience with Cate & Chloe VIP was pretty awesome. I loved the different styles of jewelry I received and really appreciated that they were packaged in jewelry boxes and bags. And on top of that I also received a cool makeup bag. I definitely felt that all the items in total were worth way way more than the $39.99 cost. Everything was quality and on trend!
