[![Quinton Shaw Anchor Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJanuary2017AusCufflinks.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Quinton Shaw** Anchor Bracelet, *Value $35*

This anchor bracelet is made of leather and the anchor pendant actually comes in gold, rose gold or silver plated. Subscribers received gold and it's just perfect.

<br>

[![Wine Aerator](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJanuary2017TheBrothersAtOtaa.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Wine Aerator** Pocket Square, *Value $10*

I think I'm going to take this for myself seeing as I am the wine drinker in the house. And can I just say, hurray to Gentleman's Box for sending a cool tool that's so very useful especially during the holiday season. It's so easy to use too, just open your bottle of red wine, pop this into the opening and pour away. You'll be amazed at how better your red wine tastes with an aerator, it's life changing.

[![Trade Union Supply Co. Lip Balm](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxJanuary2017TradeUnionSupplyCoLipBalm.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Trade Union Supply Co.** Lip Balm, *Value $*

This beard oil will condition your beard for a soft and manageable feel rather than having it oily or weighed down. It also smells great, with the scent of frankincense and a hint of mahogany. Although my husband rarely grows a beard, once in awhile he'll let it go but it still won't grow that long, so he'll most likely gift this to his buddy with a more prominent beard.
