<DT><b>Jawbone UP2</b> Gunmetal Hex</DT>
<DD>Value $99.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>So I decided to start off with the highest valued item in this box. They revealed that every box will include this Jawbone earlier this month, on the day it was released for sale to be exact. And it got sold out within hours too, crazy!</p>

<p>I currently have a FitBit, but it's the first version since I bought it years ago so this will be a good upgrade. Then my husband found out that I'll be receiving this and asked if he could have it instead, lol, so I said "okay..." The things we wives do for our husbands ;)</p>

<p>I love all the features it has, some of them are quite nifty and cool. Such as the ability to have it control any device you have that has automation and set it to operate at a certain time. For example, you can have the Jawbone to turn your music on from your Sonos device at 6am to wake you up. Or even set the temperature on your Nest at a warmer temperature closer to the time you wake up. How awesome is that!</p>
