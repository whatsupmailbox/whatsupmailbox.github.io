# First Spoiler for Luxor Box!

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxJuly2015Spoiler.png"></center>

<p>I looked into <a href="http://robynrhodes.com" target="_blank">Robyn Rhodes website</a> and her jewelries are very boho chic. It's a great style to wear during spring or summer, and I'm definitely hoping its gold since I'm not a silver person.</p>

<p>You can see her jewelries on celebrities, <a href="http://robynrhodes.com/celebrities.html/" target="_blank">click here to see pics of celebrities wearing them</a>, and there's quite a list.</p>

<p>Luxor Box is an exclusive limited subscription that only allows a certain amount of members to subscribe so there was a waiting list if you wanted to subscribe before. But good news, they have just recently increased their USA member base and re-opened the sign-up page for a limited time! The membership page will close once all the new available memberships are sold or at 11:59pm EST on June 24th (whichever comes first).</p>

<p>So if you're not a subscriber yet, you can <a href="http://www.luxorbox.com/#!become-a-member/cjg9" target="_blank"><big>subscribe here</big</a> to get the July 2015 box.</p>
