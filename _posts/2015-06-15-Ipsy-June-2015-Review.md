<p>They come packaged in a padded pink envelope, and not just any pink, bright pink!</p>
<br>

<p>Ipsy is very similar to Birchbox where all subscribers receive different variations in their bag. They try to give you products that match your needs and concerns so not everyone will get the same items.</p>

<p>This review is for my profile so its just one of the many variations that they sent out.</p>

<H4>And here are my items:</H4>
<center><img src='/images/IpsyJune2015Items.jpg'></center>
<p>The June 2015 box is themed "Swim into beauty"</big> and it's a great theme for summer!</p>

<DT>Aurora Intensive Eyeliner Pen in <i>Blackberry</i></DT>
<DD>Retail Value $7.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>Blackberry is their name for Black and you can never have enough black eyeliner, so I'm happy I got this. It also contains German ink technology that ensures a flawless even line with the ultra-thin felt tip. And I love that this eyeliner is alcohol, paraben and perfume free. I would have liked it even more if it was waterproof, and it would've also been more in line with their "Swim into beauty" theme, but that's just something minor.</p>

<DT>tresStique Mini Shadow Crayon in <i>Marimoto Pink Pearl</i></DT>
<DD>Retail Value $10</DD>
</DL>

<p>At first I thought this pencil had no lid on it but then it was just the packaging that made it look like that, silly me. I liked the color which came out to a pinky-nude with a subtle pearl finish, and application was smooth. The color will go great as an allover color or base,  and I love eye shadows where you can directly apply without a brush -makes it easy for touch ups. This shadow is also free of d5, parabens, talc, synthetic fragrances, petro chemicals and is cruelty free.</p>

<DT>J. Cat Beauty Liptitude 24/7 Hydrating Lip Stain in <i>Blow Your Mind</i></DT>
<DD>Retail Value $5.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>I liked the color but not so much the packaging. At first I thought it was a nail polish until I saw the lips on it and knew it wasn't. Since we women like to apply and re-apply our lip colors and most of the times we do that while we're out and about, packaging is important. I love whipping out my super luxurious Guerlain lipstick, it makes me feel glamorous and chic. But this I'm not so sure. I might have to just apply this at home. But, the color was good so at least I'm happy with that.</p>

<DT>Altchek MD Eye Gel Pads</DT>
<DD>2 treatments, Retail Value $4</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm a sucker for eye pads and was super happy to get 2 treatments. I work late and am constantly staring at the computer for both my job and blog, so my eyes need all the help they can get. Plus I love doing impromptu spa days at home and this is perfect for that.</p>

<DL>
<DT>Smashbox Photo Finish Foundation Primer</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size, Retail Value $8</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've tried this primer before (also sample sized) and it was good for my combination skin. The oil-free formula was much appreciated and as you know, you don't really need to use much primer with every application so this size will go a long way for me, plus it's great for travelling too!</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> VERDICT:</b> I think <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d" target="_blank">Ipsy</a> did a great job in matching the items this month to my profile. The bag was cute and is supposed to be floatable on water which I thought was pretty unique. The total value came up to $35.98 which is great for a $10 subscription, and especially when every single item in this bag is useful to me.</p>
