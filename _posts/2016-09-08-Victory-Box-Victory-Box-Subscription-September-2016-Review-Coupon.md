<H4>Items in detail:</H4>
![Victory Box - Neck Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/VictoryBoxSeptember2016WinnersCircleFashionCoNeckTie.jpg)

**Winners Circle Fashion Co.** Neck Tie, *Value $24*

This checkered patterned tie in orange and white reminds me of Halloween somehow so it'll be great for the upcoming October month. It's made of 100% cotton and should only be dry cleaned.

<br>

The branding can be seen on the back of the tie. This is a great piece to wear in fall and I'm sure I'll be seeing my husband wearing this soon!

<br>

![Victory Box - Pocket Square](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/VictoryBoxSeptember2016WinnersCircleFashionCoPocketSquare.jpg)

**Winners Circle Fashion Co.** Pocket Square, *Value $14*

A floral pocket square in orange to match the tie. It's definitely a pattern that my husband does not have yet, and he somewhat looked at it confused, but that's just him being uncomfortable wearing florals. I'm not sure what it's made of as it doesn't say, but it feels like cotton, smooth yet with texture.

<br>

![Victory Box - Silver Arrow Tie Bar](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/VictoryBoxSeptember2016TieClip.jpg)

**Silver Arrow Tie Bar**, *Value $12*

This month's surprise item is a modern arrow tie clip. It will keep your tie in place and not flying around as you move about during the day. It's silver so it'll blend in easily with any outfit.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** This month's colors have me wanting to be in October already. The tie and the tie clip was a winner in this month's box. The pocket square will take some time for my husband to get comfortable in wearing, but that's what subscription boxes are all about right, to get you to try new styles. I definitely like the addition of a surprise item everytime now, before they only sent out a tie and pocket square, so this definitely makes the cost much more worth it.
