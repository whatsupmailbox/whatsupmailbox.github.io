I love it when the time comes for Popsugar's Limited Edition box to come out every season. Fall is one of my personal favorites so I was super excited when it finally arrived on my doorstep!

<br>

The Info Card:

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

[![CAEDEN Linea No.1 Faceted Ceramic & Rose Gold Headphones](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/PopsugarLimitedEditionFall2016CaedenLineaNo1OnEarHeadphones.jpg)](http://popsugar-must-have.evyy.net/c/164125/198666/2706){:target="_blank"}

**CAEDEN** Linea No.1 Faceted Ceramic & Rose Gold Headphones, *Value $149.99*

This was revealed to be in the box so I knew I was getting this even before I received it. I was excited when I saw that I'll be getting these pretty headphones, and now I'm more excited to finally use it!

<br>

The sound on these headphones are quality, especially for its price. The white and rose gold screams feminine beauty and class, it totally fits my style. There's also buttons to control the volume and track, as well as a mic so you can use this to make or receive calls.

One thing that I was surprised with is how soft the headreset was. I wore it for quite some time while working and I didn't feel any pressure or pain.

<br>

The manual that came with these headphones consisted of pictures and legends. It's pretty straightforward but for some reason, they failed to mention which end plugs into the headphones and which end plugs into your phone. Of course by simply trying to insert it you'll find out which one it is, but I thought it should at least be stated in the manual. FYI, the end that has the rose gold goes to your phone, just like my picture above.

**Buji Baja** Lavender Rib Scarf, *Value $70*

A scarf is definitely appropriate to include for the Fall season so I wasn't surprised to see that they included this, especially since they tend to include scarves for their Fall or Winter boxes.

<br>

The scarf also came with a travel card that has tips on how to travel effortlessly, courtesy of EuroStar (a train service in Europe). I personally have used EuroStar for my travels in Europe and their trains are superb. Very classy and comfortable. And these tips are spot on when it comes to traveling in Europe. So if you're headed there, definitely take note from these tips!

**Thrive Causemetics** Triple Threat Color Stick in Joy, *Value $36*

It's called triple threat because this handy little stick serves as a blush, highlighter and lip color.

<br>

One end has a built-in brush, while the other holds the product. The brush comes in handy when you need to blend the color on your cheeks for that perfect glow or tint. What a nifty little beauty product!

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** This box was made for me! It had the right type of products and seasonally appropriate too. The fashion items are on-trend, and the beauty products are quality and useful. A great curation in my book! My favorite has got to be the headphones of course, it's such a statement piece to wear that's also functional, a combo that I need in my technological everyday life. It's so refreshing to get a box once in awhile that totally gets you and your style, and this was definitely it! Plus the total value came to a whopping $444, that's quadruple the cost! This has got to be one of my favorite limited edition boxes from them as of yet. Bravo Popsugar.
