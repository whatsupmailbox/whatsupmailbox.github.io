<p>Fall has got to be one of my favorite seasons so I was super excited about getting this box!</p>

<br>

<p>The box came inside a brown unmarked packaging which I love, it makes it less visible and unnoticed.</p>

<p>Opening this box is like opening a package coming from a high end retailer at Rodeo Drive, so gorgeous.</p>

<br>

<p>All items were wrapped individually and extra stuffing was included so that movement is kept at a minimum which translates to - everything came in one piece and in perfect condition!</p>

<H4>And without further adieu, here are the items inside my Box of Style Fall 2015 box:</H4>

<DD>Value $135</DD>
</DL>

<p>This was the Hero item of the box (Hero items are the highest valued item that's in the box and is released prior as a spoiler). I love watches and collect them and this watch is absolutely perfect for me. Rose gold with black face screams Fall très chic and I don't have grey watches so this was definitely my hero item of this year!</p>

<p>It came with a leather case that has a magnetic snap closure, plus a double wrap leather strap for that extra chic look.</p>

<br>

<p>Everything about this watch is gorgeous. I also love that they included an extra black strap for this watch. They didn't have to but they did and I totally LOVE them for it! You can buy more colors on their website and they ship free to USA from The Netherlands, but you may have to pay duty taxes.</p>

<DD>Value $55</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love ear crawlers, they're so in right now plus I love the chic and edgy look so this was another great item for me! The rose gold matches the watch and of course I'm wearing both of them together right now. #perfection</p>

<br>

<p>Putting them on was a breeze, but because my ears are somewhat petite and not fatty enough, I had to adjust it a bit by squeezing the back enclosure tighter towards my ear lobes. They are bendable enough for me to resize it, thankfully.</p>

<DD>Olive Green Color, Value $48</DD>
</DL>

<p>Another accessory that I love, hats, fedora hats to be exact. They are the perfect ending to a fall outfit and I especially love to wear them with black skinny jeans and leather booties - gorgeous.</p>

<p>At first I was completely amazed that a fedora hat was in this box (or any box for that matter) and now I just applaud Rachel Zoe for being the fashionable queen she is and including such a chic item. #amazing</p>

<p>If you asked me last year if I ever use physical notebooks, I'd look at you like "do you live in the stone age?". I mean who uses them. But that was last year. This year, surprisingly, I've been using actual notebooks to jot ideas, plans and just about anything that my mind desires. There's a sense of satisfaction you get when you're physically writing with a pen on a paper, sometimes it's just good to get back to the old ways. I especially find myself writing more on notepads when I'm travelling, it just feels better, but that's just me.</p>

<p>These notebooks are unlike any notebooks I have. I love the sleek and simple design, plus the leather feel and look gives a fashionable look that'll go with any ensemble. I'm already using the red one!</p>

<DD>Value $39</DD>
</DL>

<p>I received one of these in my Popsugar box earlier this year and I love it. The scent is heavenly (a mix of fresh, sweet and floral), and it really does moisturize your skin. It's an oil consistency with a spray application, and it's recommended to use right after you shower and towel dry. A great moisturizer for Fall and Winter!</p>

<br>

<DD>Travel Size 2fl.oz./6ml, Value $8</DD>
</DL>

<p>This is a nontoxic fabric freshener that deodorizes too. The scent is a blend lily of the valley and jasmine with sweet musk, sandalwood, and a touch of citrus. It smells refreshingly sweet and yet not too overempowering or strong. I will surely use this for when I'm travelling, but right now I'm spraying this nightly on my bed before I go to sleep. Another great scented item!</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Wow, wow and wow. That pretty much sums up my thoughts on this box. Every single item matches my fashion style and needs, eh-ve-ri-thing to the tee! I think this has got to be the best box ever and this is only the third one they've released so far. Amazing. I predict better and greater things to come and Rachel Zoe, you're AH-MAZING! Please continue to curate as well as you do and I am a loyal subscriber FOR LIFE!</p>
