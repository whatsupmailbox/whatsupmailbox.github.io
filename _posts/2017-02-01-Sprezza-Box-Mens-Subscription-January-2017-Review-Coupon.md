<H4>Items in Detail:</H4>

[![Bedford & Broome Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxJanuary2017BedfordBroomeSocks.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Bedford & Broome** Performance Socks, *Value $16*

These performance socks can be worn with dress shoes or athletic footwear. It's made with extra padding on the toe and heel, plus compression around the foot so it stays put.

I'm not so sure my husband is on board to wear this fun and bright colored socks when he works out at the gym, but it's a new year, so maybe ;)

<br>

[![Twillory Neck Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxJanuary2017NeckTie.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Twillory** Neck Tie, *Value $69*

A herringbone pattern is always a classic. And when you combine that with light and dark brown color, you got yourself a vintage gentleman look that is nothing but dapper. The color is also versatile, so you can definitely wear this with pretty much any color, and you can either wear this for casual days, or for that upcoming important meeting you have next week.

<br>

[![Thread Etiquette Anchor Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxJanuary2017ThreadEtiquetteAnchorBracelet.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Thread Etiquette** Anchor Bracelet, *Value $27*

A small piece of jewelry is always a nice finishing touch to your outfit of the day, and this nylon anchor bracelet will do just that.

<br>

[![Smart Req Cellphone Armband](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxJanuary2017SmartReqCellPhoneArmband.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Smart Req** Cellphone Armband, *Value $10*

I used to wear armbands when I was jogging a lot, and they were definitely much better than holding the actual phone on hand, or tucking it in to my pants (we've all done that before). It fits both iPhone 6/7 and iPhone 6/7 Plus, has an opening for the cables of your headphones to go through, AND it also has a pocket to insert a key (house, locker or a small car key). This will definitely be used asap!

<br>

[![Sprezza Box Fodable Water Bottle](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxJanuary2017FoldableWaterBottle.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Sprezza Box** Fodable Water Bottle, *Value $4*

I love foldable water bottles! They're so useful and don't take much space no matter where you're taking it. Most bottles take the same amount of space even when the water is all gone. But with this foldable bottle, once the water is gone, you can just fold it (from bottom to top) and tuck it into the latch so it stays folded and in one flat piece. Love it!

<br>

[![HyperGo After Sports Wipes](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxJanuary2017HyperGoAfterSportsWipes.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**HyperGo** After Sports Wipes, *Value $2*

We all know too well that when you've worked out hard and heavy, you sweat just as much. Sometimes you sneak in a little workout session when you have time, but you don't have time to take a shower immediately after. These wipes can help in situations where you need some freshness without the need for an actual shower. Just wipe from top to bottom (these can be used on the face too!) and you're all ready to go about your day again.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** This month's items are very appropriate for the new year! It inspires you to workout and it includes stylish accessories because this year is going to look better than last! I definitely love the variety of items, all very useful and good quality. A good curation for January, and a good start to the year!
