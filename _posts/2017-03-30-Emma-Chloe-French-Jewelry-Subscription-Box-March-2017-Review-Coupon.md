Emma & Chloe ships their jewelry items in this cute and unique box. I've been collecting every single one that I own to store the actual jewelry inside and display them like a book on an actual bookcase. It's such a great display!

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Open Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeMarch2017OpenBox.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=852386&U=1115177&M=65239&urllink=){:target="_blank"}
 
The box opens up like a book and inside you see their jewelry bag as well as their info magazine, "La Gazette".

<br>

**The Info Magazine, La Gazette:**

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeMarch2017LaGazetteInfoMagazine.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=852386&U=1115177&M=65239&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

Their Info Magazine is quite thick and full of useful details. I always enjoy reading them!

<br>

The first page is always their Table of Contents, and just from that page alone you can tell how much info they pack into this very useful booklet.

<br>

There's a section on romantic spots in Paris and lucky for me, I recognize some of them when I was last in Paris just a little over a year ago. It really makes me want to go back, take me back to Paris please!

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeMarch2017LaGazetteInfoMagazine04.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=852386&U=1115177&M=65239&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

There's also a recipe section for Pot-au-feu which literraly means "pot on the ire" and it's "the quintessence of French family cuisine".

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Jewelry Pouch](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeMarch2017JewelryPouch.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=852386&U=1115177&M=65239&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

Each month they send their jewelry items in a black Emma & Chloe pouch. It keeps your jewels protected and makes for a handy travel pouch to store them in.

<br>

<H4>And here is this month's jewelry item:</H4>

[![Emma & Chloe March 2017 Item - Nils Avril Audrey Gold Necklace](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeMarch2017NilsAvrilAudreyGoldNecklaceItem.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=852386&U=1115177&M=65239&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

**Nils Avril** Audrey Gold Necklace, *Value $*

Subscribers will receive this necklace in either Silver or Gold, depending on your jewelry preferences. Although I do wear both metals, I chose gold because I wear it more often than silver.

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe March 2017 Item - Nils Avril Audrey Gold Necklace Info](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeMarch2017NilsAvrilAudreyGoldNecklaceInfo.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=852386&U=1115177&M=65239&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

There's always a section in the info magazine that describes the jewelry item as well as the value. This necklace is plated with 24k gold (or deep coated in a silver bath), and glazed with colored enamel.

<br>

Here's an upclose look at the necklace:

The design is simple and alluring. It's delicate and feminine, and the touch of color (which looks like purple to me) adds an element of surprise, especially with movement.

<br>

Here's how it looks on:

I like long necklaces because not only are they great when worn alone, but they're perfect for layering with shorter necklaces or even chokers.

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe March 2017 - Certificate of Authenticity](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeMarch2017NilsAvrilCertificateOfAuthenticity.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=852386&U=1115177&M=65239&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

A Certificate of Authenticity is also always included with every jewelry that they send, so you can rest assure that you're receiving high quality and authentic items.

They also send a postcard in every box with a model wearing the featured jewelry of the month. I rarely send postcards but it's nice to keep these as it gives me some inspiration on what to wear the jewelry with.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** I LOVED this month's necklace. It's a bit out of my "statement jewelry" style but these type of delicate jewels makes the perfect compliment when I want to layer. Can't wear two statement necklaces at once right? =) And with this month's box I'm also introduced to a new jewelry brand that could be my next favorite. I looked at her other designs and wow, it's definitely my style. It also reminds me a lot of the style of House of Harlow (one of my absolute faves) with it's geometric shapes and Egyptian influence. Another great item from Emma & Chloe to add to my list!
