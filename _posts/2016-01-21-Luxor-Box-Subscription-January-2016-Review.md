<p><b>Subscription:</b> <a href="http://www.luxorbox.com/#!become-a-member/cjg9" target="_blank">Luxor Box</a></p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $125/bi-monthly for the Luxor Box (6-9 items) OR $39.95/bi-monthly for the Petite Box (3-4 items) + Free shipping.</p>
<p><b>What's in the box:</b> Items range from high-end spa products, top-shelf beauty products, jewelry, apparel, home accessories and unique treasures from around the world. Starting in September, every shipment will have a $275+ value (raised from $250)!</p>

<p>This is the fourth shipment from Luxor Box ever since it premiered in May.</p>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxJan2016Package.jpg"></center>
<p>This month's box was shipped in an unmarked brown box (it's typically white) and it's quite large in size.</p>
<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxJan2016OpenPackage.jpg"></center>
<p>Upon opening the brown box, you see the actual Luxor Box and a white package which I assume is the throw that they revealed would be in this month's box.</p>

<br>

<p>I love how they always package the inside in Luxor Box paper and finished with their sticker. It looks so chic!</p>

<br>

<p>As soon as you open the box, you see their info cards. Will get back to that later.</p>

<br>

<p>And finally the items have finally made an appearance!</p>

<br>

<p>Luxor Box details the items for the month in the form of info cards. No other subscription boxes does it this way and I like it because it doesn't take too much space if I wanted to keep them for future reference.</p>

<p>Each info card details the items, value and coupons whenever available.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Marie Belle</b> Aztec Hot Chocolate</DT>
<DD>Value $12</DD>
</DL>

<p>During winter season, there's nothing more comfy than wrapping myself up in a blanket while drinking some hot cocoa and lounging in front of the fireplace. This will surely be used for that!</p>

<p>The packaging of this hot chocolate is so pretty, definitely countertop worthy.</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxJan2016MarieBelleAztecHotChocolate2.jpg"></center>

<p>They even include different ways to prepare this hot chocolate; American Style, European Style or Mochaccino. I like both the American and European style since I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but I'm sure my husband will be trying that method.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Bliss Home & Design</b> Faux Fur Throw in Faux Fox White Fur</DT>
<DD>Value $100</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Dimensions: 50" Height x 60" Width</i></p>

<p>Subscribers received this throw in either Faux Fox White Fur, Faux Sheared Beaver Fur or Faux Dark Chocolate Channeled Mink Fur.</p>

<p>This throw is so soft and fluffy, it's also quite big for a throw. I can either use it in the living room or in my bedroom. Choices, choices.</p>

<br>

<p>Here's a look at the throw in my living room:</p>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxJan2016BlissHomeDesignFauxFurThrow2.jpg"></center>

<p>It matches my decor perfectly! Absolutely love this, I was literally clapping my hands (presumably to Luxor Box) while I was staging this, love it!</p>

<br>

<figcaption>Closer look at the throw</figcaption>

<br>

<p>Hopefully you can see from the above picture that the material is quite fluffy. I really do commend Luxor Box for including such an amazing item in this month's box!</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxJan2016EtiquetteClothiersSocks.jpg"></center>
<DL>
<DT><b>Etiquette Clothiers</b> "Lots of Cash" Cashmere Socks</DT>
<DD>Value $44</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love everything Cashmere, it's both warm and so lightweight, definitely my go-to for winter clothing. Because of that, I was super excited to get these and although I wished it was black instead, the color is still quite neutral where it would go with a lot of colors as well.</p>
<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxJan2016EtiquetteClothiersSocks2.jpg"></center>

<p>I wished it had more cashmere in them and not only 10%, but that's okay, I live in California so it doesn't get too cold here to be needing really warm socks. Can't wait to wear these!</p>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxJan2016JulesSmithScarf2.jpg"></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Jules Smith</b> Crochet Tube Scarf</DT>
<DD>Value $45</DD>
</DL>

<p>I used to not be a scarf person before my subscription addiction, but now is a different story. I do love me a good scarf but unfortunately the design on this one in particular is just not my style. Jules Smith is a great brand and I've receive quite a few items from them in the past so it's nothing against the quality or brand, just personal preference.</p>
<br>

<p>Here's a closer look at the scarf:</p>
<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxJan2016JulesSmithScarf3.jpg"></center>
<p>The material is really soft. I do wish it was in a different design so it looks somewhat good on me, but sadly no so this will be gifted.</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxJan2016MottahedehSnowflakeMug.jpg"></center>
<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxJan2016MottahedehSnowflakeMug2.jpg"></center>
<DL>
<DT><b>Mottahedeh</b> Snowflake Mug</DT>
<DD>Value $45</DD>
</DL>

<p>This is one expensive mug! But that's because Mottahedeh is a recognized leader in luxury ceramic antique reproductions and historic designs, primarily hard porcelain faience and stoneware. Although I'm not a big fan on this particular design, the whole story of it is quite interesting.</p>

<p>"National Geographic's photo archive is the inspiration for this delicate design. Each actual snowflake was originally hand painted in icy tones of blue and silver.
The story of this remarkable pattern follows:</p> 

<p>Wilson Bentley(1865–1931) of Jericho, Vermont,was a farmer and a highly-regarded amateur meteorologist who photographed snow—or more precisely, thousands of individual snow crystals. Drawn to their beauty and seemingly endless variety, Bentley isolated and captured these crystals in simple, stark photographs, creating his first successful image—a “photomicrograph” of a single snow crystal—on January 15, 1885. The creamy, matte of the black velvet fabric proved to be the perfect backdrop to showcase the beautiful, feather-like crystals. Soon, his work came to the attention of National Geographic, and Bentley published two articles—in January 1904 and January 1923—that showcased his extraordinary photography while also illustrating the basic science of snow."</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxJan2016MottahedehSnowflakeMug3.jpg"></center>

<p>The handle has a striped blue design. This mug is actually quite tall and definitely feels quality. What better mug to use with the decadent Marie Belle Aztec Hot Chocolate than this!</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxJan2016PuraBotanicaCandles.jpg"></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Pura Botanica</b> "Just Because" Candle Tin in Tea Garden and Sweet Chai</DT>
<DD>2 Candle Tins, Value $26 ($13 each)</DD>
</DL>

<p>Subscribers received 2 of the following scents: Fulfill Mint, Tea Garden, Oh-So-Citrus and Sweet Chai.</p>

<p>Everytime I travel I always have to bring some candles with me. These candles are great for travelling because of the size and that it also comes in a tin.</p>

<p>Made with 100% cosmetic grade soy wax and infused with essential oils, this will surely provide me with some aromatherapy whenever needed.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Pura Botanica</b> Botanic Bath Infusions in Lost in Lavender & Pick Me Up</DT>
<DD>2 Single Pack Bath Infusions, Value $22 ($11 each)</DD>
</DL>

<p>Subscribers received 2 of the following scents: Moments in Mint, Pick Me Up, Lost in Lavender and Rose Retreat.</p>

<p>These bath salts smell amazing! I think I may need to soak in a long hot bath tonight and use these. They are a 3-in-1 bath therapy because of the mineralizing sea salts, therapeutic essential oils and curative flowers & herbs, giving you a total restoration and relaxation experience at the same time. My body is already saying, "let's take a bath!" lol.</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxJan2016PuraBotanicaHandCreme.jpg"></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Pura Botanica</b> Lend A Hand Crème Smoother</DT>
<DD>Value $12</DD>
</DL>

<p>This is an all-natural hand crème that's made with West African Shea Butter and Aloe Vera. I always love me a good hand crème and can never have enough so this was truly appreciated. At first I was wondering why they put a turtle design on the tube, but then I learned that it's because a portion of all proceeds will benefit the National Save the Sea Turtle Foundation. Awww, I love sea turtles, they are amazing creatures and I would totally support this!</p>

<p>You can see my admiration and adoration towards sea turtles by me stalking one while snorkeling in Maui last year:</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Luxor Box is in my good list again after a <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Luxor-Box-Subscription-September-2015-Review/" target="_blank">somewhat disappointing box in September</a>. I loved that they included an ornament, very fitting for the holidays. And the hero item for me was without a doubt the Brandon Blackwood pouch/clutch, just stunning and oh-so useful. The only miss was the necklace, but thankfully the value for that wasn't too high, and even more thankfully it wasn't the big ticket item either. So so happy with everything else. Even with the miss, I think this is probably my favorite box as of yet. Hurray Luxor Box, you've won my heart again. Here's to hoping January's box will be even better (fingers crossed).</p>
