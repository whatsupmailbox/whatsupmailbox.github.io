<p>Product: DermOrganic Intensive Hair Repair Masque</p>
Price: $18 (I got this on sale for $15)

Being that I constantly color my hair and that I also have long hair, a good hair masque is a staple for me. Not only does it need to moisturize my hair, it also needs to have good and safe ingredients. Along comes DermOrganic.

First off, I love the dispenser. I hate having to squeeze hard plastic bottles just to get product out, itâ€™s not easy especially when you have wet hands in the shower. This dispenser is hand friendly. My hands thank you.
