Being that I constantly color my hair and that I also have long hair, a good hair masque is a staple for me. Not only does it need to moisturize my hair, it also needs to have good and safe ingredients. Along comes DermOrganic.

<p>First off, I love the dispenser. I hate having to squeeze hard plastic bottles just to get product out, it’s not easy especially when you have wet hands in the shower. This dispenser is hands friendly. My hands thank you.</p>

I’m impressed with their ingredients! I wish they excluded the fragrance part, but you can’t have them all.

As I pumped some out, you can smell a pleasant fragrance that’s not too strong. It's both fresh and sweet. Texture is like a thick cream that doesn’t feel too oily and I also didn’t need to put a lot for my waist length hair, which is a plus. I left it on for a couple of minutes and rinsed off. Once I towel dried my hair, I definitely noticed a big difference. Typically I would need to spray some leave-in conditioner to detangle and moisturize some more, but not this time. I combed my hair with no issues (usually it's quite tangled) and let it air dry. 

Final result, my hair was softer and very minimal frizz (which says a lot since I typically have a lot of frizz when I don’t use any product at all). My hair also felt stronger. I’m glad I found this masque and will be using this frequently.

<b>VERDICT:</b> Great hair masque that is not only effective but has natural and vegan ingredients. It’s also safe on color-treated hair. My new favorite masque!
