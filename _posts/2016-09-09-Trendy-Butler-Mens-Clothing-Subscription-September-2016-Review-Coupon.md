[Trendy Butler](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"} is a subscription that delivers brand name and trendy menswear based on a style profile that you complete upon subscribing. And since men's clothing subscription are few and limited, I'm always up for reviewing one!

When you subscribe to [Trendy Butler](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"}, you complete a style profile so that they can send out items that match your preferences and size. Each month your stylist will go through their partnered apparel network and with the criteria of your style profile, coupled with your location and feedback from previous shipments, they will select items to fit your needs at a price that wont break the bank. FYI, if you have a special occasion or specific need from time to time, you can send them a Special Request just by emailing them.

<br>

Here are a couple of examples of the Style Profile:

Now let's get to the review!

<br>

[![First look at unpacking](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/TrendyButlerSeptember2016OpenPackage.jpg)](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"}

Trendy Butler sends their items in a thick brown paper envelope and when you open that, you see the items packaged neatly inside.

<br>

<H4>Based on my husband's profile, here is what they sent:</H4>

**[Howe - 5 Star Baseball Henley Shirt](http://www.theartofstyleboutique.com/howe-5-stars-60247.html){:target="_blank}**, *Value $52*

<br>

My last package featured this brand and my husband loved it so I'm happy to find it again in this month's package. The black and blue color is also a nice combination, and the longer sleeve will fit right in as we head towards colder weather.

<br>

Here's how it looks on:

<br>

[![Trendy Butler - Howe 5 Star Baseball Henley Shirt](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/TrendyButlerSeptember2016Howe5StarsBaseballHenleyShirt02.jpg)](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"}

It has a really soft feel and it features perforated three-quarter raglan sleeves. Hard to see from the pictures, but trust me, the sleeves have little holes everywhere. Perfect for the active man and for those hot days, it'll keep you feeling cool as you go about your day.

[![Trendy Butler - Civil Society Benedict Two Button Knit Blazer](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/TrendyButlerSeptember2016CivilSocietyTwoButtonKnitBlazer.jpg)](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"}

**[Civil Society - Benedict Two Button Knit Blazer](http://www.civilsocietyclothing.com/collections/blazers/products/mcdj-170?variant=11157707973){:target="_blank"}**, *Value $190*

<br>

I was happily in awe when I saw this blazer in my package! My husband tends to wear business casual for his work and when he meets clients, he typically thrown on a blazer on top of his casual attire to make it more presentable. It's an easy way to make any attire look more professional.

<br>

Here's how it looks on:

[![Trendy Butler - Civil Society Two Button Knit Blazer](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/TrendyButlerSeptember2016Items.jpg)](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"}

As you can see, he threw this on top of the shirt and it now looks business casual. It's such an easy and effortless way to dress up if you're a man with little time to figure out what to wear. This blazer will surely get tons of wear!

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> What an amazing package this month was! It definitely hit the nail on the head in terms of sending items that match my husband's style, and that blazer, so so happy in receiving that. I felt that this month's package was perfect to send as we enter Fall season, and they took into consideration my husband's needs in attire and really delivered. It truly does feel like having your own personal stylist! Plus the value is amazing, over $200, that's more than triple the cost! Although this is only my second package from them, I'm really beginning to love this subscription and my husband now gets excited whenever he sees it arrive in our mailbox. Can't wait to see what they send next month!
