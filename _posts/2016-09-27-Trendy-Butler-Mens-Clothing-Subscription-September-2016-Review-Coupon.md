[Trendy Butler](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"} is a subscription that delivers brand name and trendy menswear based on a style profile that you complete upon subscribing. Not only do they take your profile into consideration when selecting items for you, they also take into account your location to send you appropriate weather clothes, how awesome is that! And since my husband hates shopping, this subscription has been a life saver for him!

<br>

[![First look at unpacking](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/TrendyButlerSeptember2016BOpenPackage.jpg)](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"}

Trendy Butler sends their items in a thick brown paper envelope and when you open that, you see the items packaged neatly inside.

<br>

<H4>Based on my husband's profile, here is what they sent:</H4>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

[![Thomas Payne - Rossmore Grey Pincheck Long Sleeve Shirt](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/TrendyButlerSeptember2016BThomasPayneRossmoreGreyPincheckLongSleeveShirt.jpg)](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"}

**[Thomas Payne - Rossmore Grey Pincheck Long Sleeve Shirt](https://thomas-payne.myshopify.com/collections/long-sleeve-shirts/products/rossmore-grey-pincheck-long-sleeve-shirt){:target="_blank}**, *Value $115*

<br>

Long Sleeve shirts are just what my husband loves. Not only because he uses them a lot for work, but it's also perfect as we transition from summer to fall.

<br>

This shirt has tiny checkered pattern allover and has a very light grey color.

<br>

Here's how it looks on:

Thomas Payne is an English brand specifically from London, hence the Brittish flag that's visible on the bottom of the shirt. Made of 100% cotton, this shirt is comfortable to wear and my husband loves the versatile color that can be worn with pretty much any colored pants.

**[Cohesive & Co. - Bono Pant in Burgundy](https://www.nordstromrack.com/shop/product/1583327/cohesive-co-bono-pant?color=Burgundy){:target="_blank"}**, *Value $112.50 (On Sale at Nordstrom Rack $29.97)*

<br>

Perfect timing to send these pants and the color is great too. My husband was excited to see this in the package!

<br>

The small little pocket that you would typically find inside a pocket is outside. I thought that was quite nifty and new (at least for my husband). It's just the right size to store a car key fob or anything small and important.

I thought the lining was fun as well. These pants are made of 98% cotton and 2% spandex. It has a zip fly with button closure and has 5 pockets.

<br>

Here's how it looks on:

Although these pants felt great, unfortunately the size that they sent was one size too big - you probably could see it from the pics above how loose it is. The style is also "Comfort Fit" which doesn't look well on my husband's body type. He's more of a skinny fit or straight leg type of pants. Since this was sent for a review, it's not that big of a deal. But if this ever happens to your shipment though, definitely reach out to them and they will correct it asap.

<br>

And here's how both items look together:

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> The items this month are perfect for the fall season and I definitely appreciate them sending a long sleeve shirt for my husband's work attire. Although the pants were one size too big, the style and color still fit my husband's profile. Both items were from quality and name brands which had high values. This subscription has truly helped my husband with his clothing needs and what's unique is that they send specific items that fits your needs and style all for one price. A truly different and much needed service in the clothing subscription world. If you hate shopping but don't want to sacrifice style for convenience, try them out and see how awesome this subscription is for yourself!
