<p><b>The Box:</b> <a href="https://musthave.popsugar.com">Popsugar Special Edition Summer 2015 Box</a></p>
<p><b>The Cost:</b> $100 (one time purchase)</p>
<p><b>WHATâ€™S IN THE BOX:</b> Special Edition boxes are indulgent onetime purchases that feature exclusive items and unique collaborations. 
The Summer 2015 box theme is "Set sail with the season's hottest essentials".</p>
<br>

<p>The <a href="https://musthave.popsugar.com">Popsugar Special Edition Summer 2015 Box</a> is now available!</p>

<p>Limited quantities are available, so if you plan on purchasing one, get on it before it gets sold out (and it does from past experience).</p>

<p>They haven't released any spoilers yet for this box, but I'm sure it will still get sold out fast even still. 
They just released the Limited Edition CFDA box recently and it didn't get good reviews at all -sadly. 
I was busy that day so missed out on purchasing one. I guess you could say I lucked out since the products were not for me at all and 
personally I don't think it represented CFDA very well.</p>
<p>I'm still on the fence on whether or not I should purchase the Summer box, I'm hoping a spoiler will get released before the box gets sold out #WishfulThinking.</p>
