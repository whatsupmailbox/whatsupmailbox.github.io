[Emma & Chloe](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=852386&U=1115177&M=65239&urllink=){:target="_blank"} is a French jewelry subscription box that ships a jewelry item every month that's made in France. They initially only shipped to Europe but started shipping to U.S. last year, lucky for us!

When you first subscribe, you'll be prompted to answer a couple of questions regarding your jewelry preferences such as silver or gold, and pin or clip earrings. And as a bonus for being a subscriber, you'll also receive 20% discount on anything in their online shop!

Emma & Chloe ships their jewelry items in this cute and unique box. I've been collecting every single one that I own to store the actual jewelry inside and display them like a book on an actual bookcase. It's such a great display!

<br>

The box opens up like a book and inside you see their jewelry bag as well as their info magazine, "La Gazette".

<br>

**The Info Magazine, La Gazette:**

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeJanuary2017InfoMagazine.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=852386&U=1115177&M=65239&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

Their Info Magazine is quite thick and full of useful details. I always enjoy reading them!

<br>

The first page is their Table of Content, and just from that page alone you can tell how much info they pack into this very useful booklet.

<br>

There's a section on the BEST coffee shops in Paris and boy, it really makes me wish I could visit each one of them right now!

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeJanuary2017InfoMagazine04.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=852386&U=1115177&M=65239&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

And this month they've included a recipe for Galette Des Rois which is translated as King Cake. Looks like one amazing cake that will go perfectly with some coffee or tea. The ingredients are simply and it seems quite simple to make, I must try this soon!

<br>

<H4>And without further ado, here is this month's jewelry item:</H4>

[![Emma & Chloe January 2017 Item - L'Atelier Clandestin Gold Ring](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeJanuary2017LAtelierClandestinGoldRing.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=852386&U=1115177&M=65239&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

**L'Atelier Clandestin** Gold Ring, *Value $60*

Subscribers will receive this bracelet in either Silver or Gold, depending on your jewelry preferences. Although I do wear both metals, I chose gold because I wear it more often than silver.

<br>

There's always a section in the info magazine that describes the jewelry item as well as the value. This bracelet is plated with gold (or deep coated in a silver bath), with a labradorite OR an onyx stone. I received the onyx stone.

<br>

Here's an upclose look at the ring:

The design is very simplistic, yet it definitely makes a statement thanks to the width. And the intricate design that's engraved on the ring definitely adds a touch of vintage allure.

<br>

Here's how the models wear it in the magazine:

[![Emma & Chloe January 2017 Item - L'Atelier Clandestin Gold Ring](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeJanuary2017LAtelierClandestinGoldRing05.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=852386&U=1115177&M=65239&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

The ring looks oh-so gorgeous, and so versatile that it will surely fit with any chic outfit you wear. How I wish my fingers were of normal size instead of the super tiny and skinny ones that I have. The ring is adjustable, and if your ring size is 6 or above, you can definitely wear this.

<br>


<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** I keep finding amazing new jewelry designers through Emma & Chloe and I can't seem to get enough! Every month brings new designs and different styles that I fall in love with everytime, and the quality is always high. It's definitely on par with fashion jewelry that costs upwards of $100 but only at a fraction of that price! Although I personally won't be able to wear this ring thanks to my unfortunate super petite fingers (I'm a size 3.5!), this ring would have fit perfectly with my jewelry style and collection. I love simple yet bold designs, and this surely fits that category!
