<p><a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Birchbox</a> recently had a Free Birchbox Mystery Box with $50+ Birchbox Shop Purchase, so I totally took advantage of that since I needed to upgrade my Clarisonic brush and had points to redeem as well.</p>

<br>

<p>Here is the Mystery Box that I received:</p>

<br>

<p>This box came from the November 2015 shipments. That month, I chose the guest editor box "BIRCHBOX X GLAMLIFEGURU" curated by YouTube beauty star Tati Westbrook (<a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Birchbox-Subscription-Box-November-2015-Review-Coupon/" target="_blank">read my review of it here</a>), so the box design was different and now I get this one too. 

<p>Every box that month included a LOC eye shadow stick or lipstick. I received the eye shadow stick because that's what was in the curated box, so now I'm happy to finally try out the lipstick. The color is also a gorgeous red and matte color which is a great addition to my lipstick collection.</p>

<br>

<p>Here's the complete list of what's in the box:</p>

<br>

<ul>Items in the box:
<li>Ayres Body Polish in Pampas Sunrise</li>
<li>Davines This Is A Relaxing Moisturizing Fluid (leave-in hair conditioner)</li>
<li>LOC Vibrant Matte Lipstick in Glam Life (Full Size!)</li>
<li>My Daughter Fragrances in Joyful</li>
<li>theBalm Cosmetics FratBoy Blush</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>Totally happy that I got this for FREE, especially since I was already planning on purchasing something so this was definitely an extra treat!</p>

<p>Did you take advantage of this GWP? What did you get?</p>
