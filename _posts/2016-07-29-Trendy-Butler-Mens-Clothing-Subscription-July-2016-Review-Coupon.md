[Trendy Butler](http://trendybutlers.com/share/9D37B8DF/){:target="_blank"} is a subscription that delivers brand name men's clothing based on your style profile. And since men's clothing subscription are few and limited, I'm always up for reviewing one!

<br>

When you subscribe to [Trendy Butler](http://trendybutlers.com/share/9D37B8DF/){:target="_blank"}, you complete a style profile so that they can send out items that match your preferences and size.

<br>

Here are a couple of examples of what they ask:

**CHSV** Plaid Shirt, *Value $?*

I communicated with them that my husband dresses mostly business casual and that he can never have enough dress shirts since you can wear them with jeans for a casual look, or trousers for a more formal look. So I wasn't surprised to see that they sent this shirt to me, and this was happily received too!

<br>

Here's a closer look at the collar area:

[![Trendy Butler - CHSV Plaid Shirt](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/TrendyButlerJuly2016CHSVShirt2.jpg)](http://trendybutlers.com/share/9D37B8DF/){:target="_blank"}

It says that the fit on this shirt is slim so we'll see how that looks like on me (picture below).

[![Trendy Butler - CHSV Plaid Shirt](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/TrendyButlerJuly2016CHSVShirt3.jpg)](http://trendybutlers.com/share/9D37B8DF/){:target="_blank"}

The fit is perfect and just how my husband likes them. The small plaid pattern is also a great look that adds texture but not overly loud. Perfect for business casual.

**Howe** Reversible Shorts, *Value $*

A quick search online showed that these shorts were available at Nordstrom's but no longer in stock. I am using the value based on another retailer's price.

I was surprised when I read that these shorts are REVERSIBLE! I don't think my husband has these type of shorts before and when I showed it to him, he seemed skeptical at first but became excited at the prospect of having 2 shorts in 1.

These shorts have two front pockets with a button closure and in case it's hard to see, it has a plaid design in a very light color. It's a light khaki color that is perfect for the summer season.

<br>

[![Trendy Butler - Howe Reversible Shorts](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/TrendyButlerJuly2016HoweReversibleShorts2.jpg)](http://trendybutlers.com/share/9D37B8DF/){:target="_blank"}

The back side of the shorts show two pockets that are secured with buttons. A classic design for shorts.

<br>

And here's how it looks like reversed:

[![Trendy Butler - Howe Reversible Shorts](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/TrendyButlerJuly2016HoweReversibleShorts3.jpg)](http://trendybutlers.com/share/9D37B8DF/){:target="_blank"}

When reversed, these shorts become a solid light khaki color! It still has the front two pockets, the belt loops, the button closure... it literally looks exactly like the reversible side minus the plaids. This is amazing!

The back side looks exactly the same as well! It does show the tag though, but that can easily be removed by cutting them.

<br>

And here's how it looks on:

<br>

[![Trendy Butler - Howe Reversible Shorts](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/TrendyButlerJuly2016HoweReversibleShorts5.jpg)](http://trendybutlers.com/share/9D37B8DF/){:target="_blank"}

The length is perfect and the material is lightweight. You would think that because it's reversible, it would be somewhat heavy or thick due to the extra material, but no, it's not any of that at all.

These shorts look good and feel great. An item that my husband would never have thought to purchase himself but now loves the idea!

**Ministry of Supply** Socks, *Value $*

These socks are made of.... The herringbone pattern with purple patches make a great combo.

These socks are comfortable and fit well.

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This is my first experience with Trendy Butler and I have to say that it was pretty good. My husband tends to buy his clothes from Nordstrom or Neiman Marcus and I would say that the items they sent are definitely on par in terms of quality and brand. They definitely listen to what your style or needs are and try their best to deliver. If you're a busy professional who doesn't have time to shop for clothes that often, or need additional fashion assistance to step up your style, I would say try this subscription out. It's like having a personal stylist that delivers brand name clothes to you every month. I can't wait to see what they send next month!
