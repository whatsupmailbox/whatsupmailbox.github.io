<p><a href="https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d" target="_blank">Ipsy</a> reveals are available now so you can see what you'll be getting this month in your Glam Bag.</p>

<p>You'll need to share on social media though to access this early peek, so I did with mine and here's what I'll be getting this month:</p>

</a></center>

<br>

<ul>The items are:

<li>Ipsy May 2016 Glam Bag</li>
<li>Smashbox X-Rated Mascara</li>
<li>Pacifica - Natural Mineral Coconut Eye Shadow Trio</li>
<li>Hikari Cosmetics - Shimmer Bronzer</li>
<li>The Organic Pharmacy - Antioxidant Lip Balm</li>
<li>Etat Libre d'Orange - Remarkable People Fragrance</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>I was really hoping to get the pink version of the bag, but oh well. So far I'm not too impressed with my items but I typically change my mind once I have them on hand so hopefully this is the case.</p> 

<p>Will you be taking a peek at your glam bag this month?</p>
