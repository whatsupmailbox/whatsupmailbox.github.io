<p>FabFitFun is one of my favorite subscriptions because they have such a good mix of products in their boxes everytime! So as soon as I saw my mailman walking towards my door with this purple box, I just went straight for him. Yes, I was that excited to open this box!</p>

<p>Spoilers were released earlier for some items, but it's still exciting for me to actually finally have it in my hands.</p>

<figcaption>The info magazine</figcaption>
<br>

<p>This month FabFitFun changed their info sheet into a magazine. I actually love it! It's very informational and even modeled every item in the box so we can see how it's on/used. So very helpful!</p>

<p>Here are some pages from the info magazine:</p>

</a></center>

<br>

<p>I love how they tell the background of the company, tips on using the items and even some interviews with the artists behind the designs. So much better than their previous info sheets.</p>

<br>

<H4>And here are the items inside:</H4>

</a></center>
<br>

<p>OMG, there's so many items in here! I think this is the most FabFitFun has ever sent and even before I go into each item, I already can sense that this might be my favorite from them yet!</p>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

<DL>
<DT>Gold Radiance Luxury Facial Mask by Passport to Beauty</DT>
<DD>2 masks, Value $65</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm a mask junkie so everytime I find them in my sub boxes, I'm already thrilled and happy. This one has gold in it which I know is very beneficial and effective when infused in skincare. It's very luxurious indeed... 2 masks for $65, um yeah, I'm gonna save this for when I really want to treat myself with a home spa, accompanied by some Veuve Clique champagne, Rose macarons and I'll light up my Jo Malone candle. Yep, I'll be going the whole nine yards with this!</p>

</a></center>
<DL>
<DT>FabFitFun x Tappan Collective Umbrella in <i>Pink</i></DT>
<DD>Value $32</DD>
</DL>

<p>The artist is LA-based so that already got my attention. Plus I love pink! Although it doesn't rain much in LA, an umbrella is always needed since I do travel to places/countries where it rains. The design is cute with prints that say "Rain Rain Go Away" all over, adorable.</p>

<DT>Lucky Lip Stain by Manna Kadar Cosmetics</DT>
<DD>Value $24</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've used Manna Kadar lip products before thanks to Birchbox and I do like them. Their ingredients are natural and this 3-in-1 lip product is a combination of a primer, lip gloss, and lip stain all-in-one! It moisturized my lips and although it's a lip gloss, there's very minimal shine which I love. It definitely give me a dewy rosey natural lip look. Love it!</p>

<DT>HISY Batter Pack in <i>Teal</i></DT>
<DD>Value $24.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>I actually don't have a battery pack. I never found a need for it, but now that I have one in hand, I'm sure I'll be thinking to myself "why did I never use this before!" lol. Subscribers received either this Teal color, or a Pink or Mint Green one.</p>

<center><a href="http://xo.fff.me/cAIsf" target="_blank">
<img src="/images/FabFitFunFall2015Battery2.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="HISY Battery Pack" />
</a></center>

<p>Although their info magazine shows this battery pack hooked up to an iPhone using the included USB cable, the other end is a micro USB which does not work on iPhones so I'm not sure why it's shown that way. You have to use your own iPhone charging cable which is not a big deal. The included cable can then be used to charge the actual battery pack.</p>

<p>There is a power button on the side, and when you do turn it on, there's a light blue strip of light that will start flashing on the front of the battery pack. You can see the light on the picture above.</p>

</a></center>
<DL>
<DT>Strength Tubing Ankle & Total Body Tone DVD by Merrithew</DT>
<DD>1 Tube & 1 DVD, Value $33</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love it when FabFitFun sends out fitness products, it motivates me to get back on track with my fitness goals.</p>

<center><a href="http://xo.fff.me/cAIsf" target="_blank">
<img src="/images/FabFitFunFall2015Tubing2.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="Strength Tubing Ankle & Total Body Tone DVD by Merrithew" />

<p>I actually have this tube already! You can even read a review of it here. I purchased it earlier this year and shipping is actually expensive since they are a Canadian company, so I'm happy I get another one without that hassle!</p>

<p>It's very easy to use and boy does it work your legs out. You can of course use it for toning other parts of your body depending on the exercises you do, but they are a great addition to your workout tools and one that I cannot live without now. The DVD that comes in this set is also very helpful and helps you utilize the tube to its full potential. I have another DVD from Merrithew that's for Tubing as well, but this one focuses more on total body workout whereas the one I have focuses on lower body strength.</p>

<DT>Glass Crystal Bead Bracelet by Tribe Alive</DT>
<DD>Value $49</DD>
</DL>

<p>Yay, a jewelry item! I loved the necklace they included in the Summer Box (read my review here), so I was hoping for another jewelry piece. This bracelet is what I would consider boho chic, and it is pretty, but I'm not sure I would have bought it at $49. But it does go towards a good cause as Tribe Alive partners with artisans all over the world to employ impoverished women by providing them with a sustainable income.</p>

<br>

<p>Subscribers received either the Aquamarine color (the one I received), White Jade, Grey Jade, or Dark blue. I like mine, it's very calming and pretty on my tanned skin. I think it will look good stacked with the white one too so I may have to try to swap for another one!</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> One word, WOW! There were so many items they included in this box and all of them useful and of such great quality. This is definitely my favorite box from them as of yet. I also love that they changed their info sheets to a magazine now, that was such a great move. With a total value of $357, this is an absolute must have subscription box, especially if you're into cool and trendy products.</p>
