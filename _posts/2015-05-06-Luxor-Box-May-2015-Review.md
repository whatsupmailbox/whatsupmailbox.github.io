I love the tifanny blue color of the box, it already screams luxury to me. And they definitely paid attention to the packaging details -I think the sleeve on the box adds that extra touch of luxury.

<a href="https://www.lisastewartonline.com/collections/bar-none-stud-earrings/">Lisa Stewart Bar None Stud Earrings</a> $85
<p>This was one of the items they revealed earlier last month. They didn't actually say what the item was, only that it was a jewelry piece from Lisa Stewart, so I was hoping for a necklace. I'm not sure how I feel about these earrings but maybe they'll grow on me as I wear them. It's made of sterling silver vermeil, 14k gold plated with genuine cubic zirconia stones.</p>

<a href="http://www.redcarpetkolour.com/order_rck.html">Red Carper Kolour Body Glow in Medium</a> - FULL SIZE! $49.95
<p>This was their second spoiler that they sent last month as well. They didn't mention the brand, but teased that it <i>"was developed by an expert that works with the Hollywood stars. This product has become a Red Carpet favorite!"</i> I'm not sure if everyone got this in Medium, but I'm sure glad I did because it suits my skintone.</p>

![Luxor Box May 2015 Sucre](/images/LuxorBoxMay2015Sucre.jpg)
<a href="http://www.chambredesucre.com/products/his-hers-limited-edition-box">Chambre De Sucre Sugar Balls - His & Hers Set</a> FULL SIZE! $26

<p>This two piece set features their Colored Sugar Balls and our Coffee Sugar Balls. The Colored Sugar Balls come in a mixed paster selection of pink, green, yellow and white -there's no difference in taste though. It's made with pure can sugar. The Coffee Sugar Balls are made with dark brown sugar and has no coffee flavor.</p>

<p>I've actually tried their fancy sugars before and absolutely love them! My afternoon teas have never looked so good. And I think the name of the set is perfect and would be great for gifting a newlywed or couples who love tea/coffee.</p>
