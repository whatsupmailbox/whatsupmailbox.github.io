<br>

[![Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxOctober2016Info03.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

There's a dedicated section for each product describing the brand behind it and the actual item and what it does. I find it very helpful and really appreciate the effort they put in making this info magazine.

<br>

<H4>And here are all the items:</H4>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

[![Unsimply Stitched Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxOctober2016UnsimplyStitchedSocks.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Unsimply Stitched** Socks, *Value $12*

<br>

Socks are one of those items that my husband can't get enough of so he's always happy when he receives them. The colors on these socks represent autumn nicely and the inclusion of orange is appropriate for October. It feels nice and fits well too, my husband is happy with these.

<br>

[![Eezy Wear Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxSeptember2016EezyWearTie.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Eezy Wear** Tie, *Value $23*

<br>

This tie is modern and simple, my husband's favorite type of tie.

<br>

[![Gentlemen Essentials Pocket Square](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxOctober2016GentlemenEssentialsPocketSquare.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Gentlemen Essentials** Pocket Square, *Value $15*

<br>

The orange stitching on this pocket square will go well with the socks and tie. The paisly design in dark blue will blend well with a dark gray or blue suit. A great pocket square that my husband can add to his collection.

<br>

[![Collar Bar](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxOctober2016CollarBar.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Collar Bar**, *Value $20*

Upon first opening this little box up, I wasn't really quite sure what it was. At first I thought it was a tie bar, but it's actually a collar bar!

<br>

Here's a closer look at the collar bar:

[![Collar Bar](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxOctober2016CollarBar02.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

<br>

And here's how it's supposed to be worn:

<br>

[![Collar Bar](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxOctober2016CollarBarInfo.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

"The collar bar has two purposes. First it holds your shirt collar tight and clean. Second, it can be used to raise your tie knot slightly for a more boastful look."

What a nifty little accessory that my husband was quite excited to try out!

<br>

[![Boomer & Co. Body Wash](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxOctober2016BoomerCoOrganicWash.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Boomer & Co.** Body Wash, Travel Size 2 fl. oz. *$bonus*

*Note: This bottle came sealed*

<br>

Because this is a bonus item, the value was not included.

This is an all-natural body wash for men in the scent Citrus & Cedar. The scent is fresh, manly and woody which my husband found to be pleasant. He's also happy with the convenient size which will come in handy when he travels.

<br>

[![DeadSoxy Shoe Laces](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxOctober2016CollarBar.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**DeadSoxy** Shoe Laces, *Value $8*

In honor of Breast Cancer Awareness month, they've sent these shoe laces in pink. My husband actually feels comfortable wearing pink and shoe laces aren't that big of a statement when worn so even if you may not be comfortable wearing this color, it won't be too much of a commitment and you can still wear them to respect and observe Breast Cancer Awareness month.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** As always, Gentleman's Box delivers items that are useful, functional and exciting. The collar bar was such a cool item to receive, I never knew such a thing existed if it wasn't for this box. I also enjoyed the colors incorporated in this month's box, it had both orange for autumn and Halloween, and it also included pink for Breast Cancer Awareness month. An all around good box with a great variety of items that any gentleman can surely use!
