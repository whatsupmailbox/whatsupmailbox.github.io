**Winners Circle Fashion Co.** Neck Tie, *Value $24*

The colors on this tie are perfect for summer, it reminds me of a cool aqua blue pool.

The pattern is very modern and personally I think it will go great with many summer outfits.

**Winners Circle Fashion Co.** Pocket Square, *Value $14*

Pocket Squares used to be something that my husband wouldn't wear in a million years. But after getting introduced to them through subscription boxes, he is now super comfortable in wearing them. In fact, he finds himself grabbing for one to complete his look when he's going to any event, be it casual or formal.

<br>

This pocket square is made of 100% cotton. It feels soft and high quality. Plus the checkered pattern is super versatile so you know it can go with just about anything.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** This is a great box to subscribe to if you love accessorizing and wear ties frequently. You'll certainly upgrade your look and be color coordinated too. At only $16/month, this is certainly one subscription to have even if you're new to accessorizing. A great tie will always find a need one day or another. And what better way to get them than at a deal and in your mailbox every month!
