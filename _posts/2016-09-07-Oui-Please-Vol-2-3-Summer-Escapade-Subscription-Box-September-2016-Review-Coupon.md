![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 Package](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016Package.jpg)

[OuiPlease](https://ouipleasebox.com){:target="_blank"} safely packs their precious boxes inside a bigger black packaging box. They are also shipped through UPS Ground so if you're registered with My UPS, you'll get notification as soon as it's shipped and tracking details too.

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 Open Package](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016OpenPackage.jpg)

When you open the packaging, you see a big white cardstock with a French phrase. Every box has a different word and this time it's Rêve, which is Dream in French. 

<br>

Under that you finally see the box neatly and safely packaged inside, surrounded by bubble wrap.

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016Unboxing.gif)

Et voila, the infamous OuiPlease box! I love love love these boxes, they're so strong and sturdy, I use them as keepsake boxes for tons of stuff! From jewelry, to beauty products and so much more. Best reusable box out there amongst all the other subscription boxes!

<br>

**The Info Magazine:**

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016Info.jpg)

Oui Please always includes a catalog magazine listing all the items that were included for the current Volume box. I think it's great and so informational, plus they're made with such good quality, I collect all of them to browse around when I have French withdrawals.

<br>

Here's a look inside the booklet:

![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 Les Interchangeables Beige Star Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016LesInterchangeablesBeigeStarBracelet.jpg)

**Les Interchangeables Beige Star Bracelet**, *Value $35*

I love these bracelets and collect them! I have three so far so this will be my fourth, I just can't seem to get enough of them, especially since they look amazing when stacked together.

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 Les Interchangeables Beige Star Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016LesInterchangeablesBeigeStarBracelet02.jpg)

The design on this bracelet has five stars in a row with Swarovski crystals in between them. It's so gorgeous and rocker chic at the same time, love it!

<br>

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 Les Interchangeables Beige Star Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016LesInterchangeablesBeigeStarBracelet04.jpg)

The band is a stretchable ribbon and it's also adjustable. The tag on the back also completes the luxe look of this bracelet. I'm so in love with this design, I think I need to add more in different colors to my collection. There goes my #nospend goal.

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 - Les Nereides Paris Blackberry Charm Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016LesNereidesParisBlackberryCharmBracelet.jpg)

**Les Néréides Paris** Blackberry Charm Bracelet, *Value $60*

Another pretty bracelet! The charm itself is in the shape of a blackberry, but the color is red which I totally prefer. Delicate jewelries are one of my favorites so this was happily received.

<br>

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 - Les Nereides Paris Blackberry Charm Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016LesNereidesParisBlackberryCharmBracelet03.jpg)

This bracelet is also adjustable and made of hand-enameled brass and 14k gold plated brass chain.

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 - Mille et Une Fouta Towel](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016MilleEtUneFoutaTowel.jpg)

**Mille et Une Fouta Towel**, *Value $25*

This towel was revealed to be in every subscribers box. It's made of 100% cotton and is quite large!

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 - Mille et Une Fouta Towel](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016MilleEtUneFoutaTowel02.jpg)

I had a hard time stretching the towel completely for you to see how big it is in size for this picture, mind you I'm quite petite, but it actually is really big. It's lightweight though, so you can easily pack this in your bag. 

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 - C.Lavie Serum Eclat](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016CLavieSerumEclat.jpg)

**C.Lavie** Serum Eclat, *Value $130*

This serum promises to effectively illuminate and even out your complexion, by brigthening and reducing the appearance of discoloration and red blotches. It's lightweight, absorbs quickly and the scent is fresh.

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 - Pomone Paris Munificence Creme Jour & Nuit](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016PomoneParisMunificenceCremeJourNuit.jpg)

**Pomone Paris** Munificence Creme Jour & Nuit, 15ml *Value $19.50*

This day & night cream targets the signs of aging and is recommended for all skin types. 

<br>

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 - Pomone Paris Munificence Creme Jour & Nuit](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016PomoneParisMunificenceCremeJourNuit03.jpg)

The packaging was fun to open and the size of this jar is actually a travel size version, the full size is 50ml. I'm very picky with my moisturizers as I have sensitive skin so unfortunately this will have to be gifted.

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 - Nailmatic Nail Polish in Lena & Dina](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016NailmaticNailPolishLenaDina.jpg)

**Nailmatic** Nail Polish in Dina & Lena, *Value $14 each*

I love trying out new nail polishes and I've never heard of this one! Dina is the light pastel pink color, and Lena is the violet pastel color.

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 - Nailmatic Nail Polish in Lena & Dina](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016NailmaticNailPolishLenaDina02.jpg)

These nail polishes have a 4-free formula and are also sold in vending machines in France and it works just like the Essie nail polish vending machines you see at certain airports.

<br>

Here's how the colors look on me:

![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 - Nailmatic Nail Polish in Lena & Dina](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016NailmaticNailPolishLenaDina03.jpg)

I definitely love the pink more, which is Dina. The violet pastel color (Lena) just looks a bit off on my skin tone - not bad, just not great either. But they did apply smoothly and it only took 2 coats for me to complete my nails.

<br> 

![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 - Saisons D'Eden Paris Le Creme De Beaute Revitalizing Cream](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016SaisonsDEdenParisLeCremeDeBeauteRevitalizingCream.jpg)

**Saisons D'Eden Paris** Le Creme De Beaute Spring - Summer Revitalizing Cream, *Value $54*

This cream moisturizer is made for normal to dry skin. It's on the rich and thick side so it'll be great for winter and nighttime. The ingredients are natural and the scent is sweet and fresh, it reminds me of sweet grapes for some reason.

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 - Nuxe Huile Prodigieuse Multi Purpose Dry Oil](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016NuxeHuileProdigieuseMultiPurposeDryOil.jpg)

**Nuxe** Huile Prodigieuse Multi Purpose Dry Oil, 30ml, *Value $17.50*

I have tons of this dry oil thanks to other subscription boxes, but they are really good so I can't complain in getting more! You can use this oil on your skin or hair, but I mostly use it on my body both to moisturize and to give it a good glow.

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 - Boissier Paris Strawberry Lemon Bon Bons](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016BoissierParisStrawberryLemonBonBons.jpg)

**Boissier Paris** Lemon & Strawberry Bon Bons, *Value $12.50 each*

How cute is this packaging! I love Boissier. I received their chocolate in my Vol. 2.2 box and they were so tasty!

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 - Boissier Paris Strawberry Lemon Bon Bons](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016BoissierParisStrawberryLemonBonBons02.jpg)

These bon bons are so yummy. They have a thin layer of hard shell and once you get through that, it's all soft center. They're not too sweet, but just enough to make this a truly special treat to enjoy.

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.3 - Herbes De Provence](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol23September2016HerbesDeProvence.jpg)

**Herbes De Provence**, *Value $12*

Herbes de Provence is a mix of dried herbs that's typically found in the South of France. This mix in particular is made with thyme, rosemary, oregano, and sweet basil. You can use this in your cooking, barbecue, sauces, marinades and so much more.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** This "Summer Escapade" box probably would have been more appreciated during the summer, but thankfully I live in Los Angeles where even in early September it's still hot and sunny, so I can still fully appreciate all the items in this box. There were a couple of brand repeats in this box from Vol. 2.2, but I loved those brands so I'm totally not complaining! One thing that I probably was not expecting was the amount of face creams I received, 3 in total! Personally I'm not too excited about skincare since I have very specific needs and super sensitive skin, but that's just me. I'm sure those of you who are skincare addicts would rejoice in receiving these moisturizers. All totaled up, the value of this box came up to $

If you haven't subscribed yet, you can [subscribe here] (https://ouipleasebox.com){:target="_blank"} and use coupon code **OUIWHATSUP** to get 20% off any subscription. That brings the cost down to $120 for one box or $520 for a whole year! That's a très good deal! 

*FYI, Vol. 2.2 box is still available so if you subscribe now, you'll be getting this box. Just remember that variations exist for this subscription so you may not be getting the same items as me, but the personalized scarf will for sure be included.*
