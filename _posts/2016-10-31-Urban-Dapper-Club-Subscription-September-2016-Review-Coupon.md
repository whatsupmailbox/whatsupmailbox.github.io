<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

![Unsimply Stitched Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/UrbanDapperClubSeptember2016UnsimplyStitchedSocks.jpg)

**Unsimply Stitched** Socks, *Value $12*

<br>

I say this all the time, but it's true, my husband can never have enough socks so he's always happy when he receives them. He's also familiar with this brand as he's received them in other subscription boxes before, so he knows that the quality is good as well as the fit. The blue color on the pattern is also great and will go well with either casual (jeans) or more formal (dark blue suit), so it's a very versatile design and one that he's happy to add to his sock collection.

<br>

![Urban Dapper Club Neck Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/UrbanDapperClubSeptember2016NeckTie.jpg)

**Urban Dapper Club** Neck Tie, *Value $25*

<br>

The dark blue paisley pattern is traditional and timelessly classic.

<br>

![Urban Dapper Club Neck Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/UrbanDapperClubSeptember2016NeckTie02.jpg)

This will definitely go well with the socks, and the 100% polyester material makes this tie durable and easy to care for.

<br>

![Urban Dapper Club - Feather Tie Bar](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/UrbanDapperClubSeptember2016FeatherTieBar.jpg)

**Urban Dapper Club** Feather Tie Bar, *Value $15*

This tie bar is really well made. It's not made of thin materials and is quite sturdy. I also like that they included a blue dot at the end of the feather tip to tie in with the blue colors on the rest of the accessories from this box. It fits perfectly well with the tie and adds a nice modern touch to it.

<br>

![Urban Dapper Club Pocket Square](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/UrbanDapperClubSeptember2016PocketSquare02.jpg)

**Urban Dapper Club** Pocket Square, *Value $15*

<br>

Although this box is a September box, I only recently received it this month so it's perfect for the October color theme. Orange is great for autumn and also fitting for Halloween season.

<br>

![Urban Dapper Club Pocket Square](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/UrbanDapperClubSeptember2016AshEmberCoSexPantherMensBodyWash.jpg)

**Ash & Ember Co.** Sex Panther Men's Body Wash, 4 oz. *$8*

*Note: This bottle did not come sealed*

<br>

I'm not sure why the info card states the value of this body wash as $13, perhaps that's for the bigger size, but for the 4 oz. size, it's being sold at $8 so that's the value I put.

OMG, this men's body wash has a really sexy scent that I'm immediately attracted to as a female, no wonder they call this scent Sex Panther! I put this baby in our bathroom right away for my husband to use! And I may or may not have taken all the other body washes away too so that there's no other option for him to use ;)

In case you want to check them out, their products are sold through [their Etsy Shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ashandemberstudios?ref=l2-shop-info-avatar){:target="_blank"}. It's all-natural and is also Paraben-Free, Alcohol-Free, Cruelty-Free, Mineral Oil-Free and Hypoallergenic.

Such a great product, I've already added this shop to my favorites and will be adding their soy candle with this sexy scent to my collection soon!

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** This was my first Urban Dapper Club box to review and it was really fun to unbox especially since I didn't know what to expect. It definitely delivers on providing you with dapper accessories, and although all 3 styling items were from their in-house brand, it was still well made and the colors and style are current with the season. I especially loved the discovery of the Ash & Ember brand which I wouldn't have ever come across if it wasn't for this box, so thank you Urban Dapper for that awesome product! For the price you pay, you definitely get more than your money's worth, and if you're a gentleman who needs to have your style on point, definitely try this box out and get dapper accessories delivered straight to your door!
