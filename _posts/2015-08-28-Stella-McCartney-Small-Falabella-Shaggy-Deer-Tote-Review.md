<p><b>The Product:</b> Stella McCartney "Small Falabella" Shaggy Deer Tote</p>
<p><b>The Price:</b> $1195</p>
<p><b>Where I purchased this from:</b> <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com" target="_blank">Nordstrom.com</a>

<p>I've been eyeing the Falabella tote for awhile now but originally they only had it with silver metal, and I prefer gold. But then they released the gold version a few months ago and I was so tempted, and finally this week I decided to dive in and buy it! It was one of those days where I felt like "you only live once so why not" lol =P</p>

<p>I can honestly say that ever since I got my hands on this gorgeous tote, I haven't been able to wear any other bag. I just keep reaching for this. It's not only gorgeous, but it also can fit quite a lot of stuff inside. I can see this being my go-to bag for travelling too.</p>

<p>And another feature that's a plus, you can wear it as a clutch too! A big one, but a clutch nevertheless. All you have to do is fold the top over to one side and voila, a clutch it is. See picture below:</p>

<p>In case you didn't know, Stella McCartney never uses real leather in all her products. The material they use is of high quality and distressed with a unique technique that feels and looks like leather, and just as durable too.</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This is definitely my current "it" bag and I'm so glad I purchased this. It's gorgeous, can fit a lot of stuff, and can be worn as a clutch too. It's definitely worth its price and then some!</p>
