<H4>Items in Detail:</H4>

[![OTAA of Australia Neck Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxNovember2016OTAAOfAustraliaNeckTie.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**OTAA of Australia** Necktie, *Value $40 AUD (approx. $29 USD)*

My husband loves the straight cut style neckties, so he was super happy to find this in the box! Not only is it modern but it's also on trend with the current fashion. This knit tie is perfect for pretty much any season especially with the grey color, so versatile.

<br>

[![William & Sterling Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxNovember2016WilliamSterlingSocks.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**William & Sterling** Socks, *Value $15*

These socks are manly yet so fun! I love how it has mustaches allover, perfect for "Movember". It's also soft and comfy, and the grey color can be worn with pretty much anything. Plus when you sit down and have your socks shown to the world, the world will smile and say, "you're cool".

<br>

**Sprezza NYC** Light blue Tie Clip, *Value $18*

At first I thought, what a unique color when I saw this in the box. There's actually a reason to it. To raise awareness for Prostate Cancer, the tie clip was hand-painted in baby blue color since it's the foundation's color. It will surely stand out and be a conversation piece when you wear this at parties, and that's when you can proudly explain what it stands for!

**Kegs & Code Co.** Brew Passport, *Value $23.90*

This little book is a fun way to record and keep track of your beer tastings so you will always remember how they taste like.

<br>

Here are some pics of the pages inside:

It's a handy little book to have, especially when you're traveling to a place with lots of foreign beer, or even to gift to someone who loves beer. They'll finally have a reason why they should be drinking lots of it, it's for research, duh! ;)

<br>

[![Wooden Pocket Comb](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxNovember2016WoodenPocketComb.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Wooden Pocket Comb**, *Value $9*

When I saw this as I was unboxing I thought to myself, I don't think my husband has a decent comb that he uses. It's mostly those small black plastic ones that you see at typical barber shops. Now he can brush his hair with pride, and I don't have to be embarassed myself, phew!

<br>

[![Tinker, Dicker & Doc Lavender Candle](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxNovember2016TinkerDickerDocLavenderCandle.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

[![Tinker, Dicker & Doc Lavender Candle](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxNovember2016TinkerDickerDocLavenderCandle02.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Tinker, Dicker & Doc** Lavender Candle, *Value $7*

What a cute little candle tin that is totally travel friendly. The scent is lavender and I think I'm going to steal this for myself. I'm a big candle addict plus I don't think my husband has ever lit a candle in his life.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** Wow, Sprezza Box is really stepping up their game with this month's box! It's all very festive and all the items will definitely be used. It also makes for such a great gift with the variety of items it has, and with a total value of $101, that's amazing for its $28 cost. Such a great subscription box to gift to yourself or to that special man in your life!
