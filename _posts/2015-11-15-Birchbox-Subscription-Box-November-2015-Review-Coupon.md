<H4>And here are my items:</H4>

<br>

<p>I received 5 items this month and because I chose the curated box, I knew exactly what I was going to get, but it was so long ago that I actually forgot what it was.</p>
<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT>LOC One & Done Shadow Stick</DT>
<DD>Full Size, Value $10 </DD>
</DL>

<p>I love eyeshadow sticks, they're so convenient and easy to use. The color I received is a gold tone that will go great for the festive holidays.</p>

<br>

<DL>
<DT>Shiseido Ultimune Eye Power Infusing Eye Concentrate</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size, Value $10 (Full Size $)</DD>
</DL>


<p>This eye concentrate will help firm the skin around your eyes and also help with dark circles. I always incorporate an eye serum in both my morning and night skincare, so I will surely be using this.</p>

<br>

<img src="/images/BirchboxNov2015JouerLipTreatment.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="Jouer Lip Enhancer" />
</a></center>

<DL>
<DT>Jouer Lip Enhancer</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 0.14fl.oz., Value $.50 (Full Size 10oz. $34)</DD>
</DL>

<p>This balm not only moisturizes your lips, but it also helps minimize lines and increase fullness. It has a glossy look to it, but not too much and although typically lip products that plump your lips would either sting or give out a tingly feeling, this one doesn't.</p>

<br>

<center><a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">
<img src="/images/BirchboxNov2015LivingProofDryShampoo.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="Living Proof Perfect Hair Day (PhD) Dry Shampoo" />
</a></center>

<DL>
<DT>Living Proof Perfect Hair Day (PhD) Dry Shampoo</DT>
<DD>Travel Size 1oz., Value $6.50 (Full Size 4oz. $26)</DD>
</DL>

<p>I always need and use dry shampoos and I chose this curated box especially to get this! I use quite abit of Living Proof products and love them, but I've never tried their dry shampoos before.</p>

<br>

<center><a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">
<img src="/images/BirchboxNov2015AveneHydranceSerum.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="Avène Hydrance Optimale Hydrating Serum" />
</a></center>

<DL>
<DT>Avène Hydrance Optimale Hydrating Serum</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size 0.05fl.oz./1.5ml., Value $1.9 (Full Size 60ml, $75)</DD>
</DL>

<p>Although I rarely use hydrating serums as I have oily/combination skin, the dry winter weather (or just plain dry since I live in California) does take its toll on my skin so I get some dry patches now and then. I used it only once so far and the gel-like formula went on smoothly and dried fast, and although it was too early to tell, I did feel somewhat more moisturized in the areas I applied this.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I knew exactly what I was receiving this month because I chose the curated box, and I'm glad I did. Every item will be used and I may be purchasing full-sized versions of some or all of them. The total value came up to $ which is great for the cost of this box. Even with a bad box the value has always still been there for me. I find Birchbox to be a great subscription to discover and try new products at the convenience of your own home and without talking to some beauty sales rep who may or may not be right. I recommend Birchbox to all my friends and it's no surprise that they end up subscribing right away =)</p>
