![Victory Box - Neck Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/VictoryBoxAugust2016WinnersCircleFashionCoNeckTie.jpg)

**Winners Circle Fashion Co.** Neck Tie, *Value $24*

This paisley patterned tie in blue with a bright yellow background makes quite a statement.

I don't think my husband has this pattern yet, not sure if paisley is his thing, but there's always a first right. Plus that's what subscription boxes are all about, to try out new things and who knows, it just might be his new favorite pattern.

<br>

![Victory Box - Pocket Square](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/VictoryBoxAugust2016WinnersCircleFashionCoPocketSquare.jpg)

**Winners Circle Fashion Co.** Pocket Square, *Value $14*

This pocket square has all around symbols on it and it actually looks really nice! At first I thought they were plus signs and hashtags, which would have been cool, but I think it's plus signs and ribbons.

This pocket square is made of 100% microfiber and has a bit of stiffness which I prefer. That way you can shape it any way you want without having it be all flimsy. I wouldn't have thought that this pocket square would match the included tie, but it really does, it breaks down the busy paisley pattern and creates a well put together look.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** One thing I love about subscription boxes is that they bring you out of your comfort zone and make you try new things. My husband would never have in a million years picked out these items and he probably would end up wearing the same old patterns everytime. But now thanks to subscription boxes, he's upgraded his look and expanded his style! If you wear a lot of ties either for work or because you're just that dapper type of man, this is a great box to subscribe to. At only $16/month, what's there to lose, especially since most ties cost double anyway. Plus this way you won't have to spend time figuring out what tie matches what pocket square, they style it for you!
