# Birchbox Items

<p>This box has motivated me to plan my next vacation and fill it with adventure! I've already narrowed down my destination to two places, so its progress =)</p>

<p>Just like I mentioned in <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Birchbox-June-2015-Review/" target="_blank">my Birchbox review last week</a>, for June they included a sweepstake in each box. You see that card that says "You've got big plans..."? That's the sweepstake card and behind it is a code that you enter on their website to see what your prize is. You can enter your code <a href="http://www.birchbox.com/sayyes" target="_blank">here</a> and tell me what you won, I'm curious!</p>
<p>I entered my code and got a 10% off coupon. I got a 20% off coupon in my first box last week, so it's always kind of sad to get something less than what you're used to. I'd love to find out what others got with their codes, share please!</p>
<br>

<DT>Now let's move on to the products inside!</DT>

<p><center><img src='/images/BirchboxJune2015BItems2.jpg'></center></p>
<H4>My products:</H4>
<DL>
<DT>Skyn Iceland - Hydro Cool Firming Eye Gels</DT>
<DD>1 treatment, Value $3.75</DD>
</DL>

<p>Eye gels are a life saver for my tired eyes and I've tried this specific one before thanks to Birchbox and it was ultra refreshing, so I'm happy I got it again.</p>

<DL>
<DT>Marcelle - BB Cream Golden Glow</DT>
<DD>Deluxe sample 0.24 oz/7 ml, $4.05</DD>
</DL>

<p>So I got this in my first Birchbox last week and based on pictures I saw on Instagram, it seems like a lot of subscribers got this specific item. I kind of wished I got something else since I already have this, but oh well, another one doesn't hurt.</p>
<p>Here's what I said about this item in my review last week: I love BB creams because it cuts my makeup routine in half by being an all-in-one moisturizer and foundation. This cream promises to hydrate and calm skin, evens tone, control shine, lightly masks imperfections, and infuse skin with a radiance glow (thanks to tiny flecks of light-reflecting pigments). I also like that its paraben free and oil free which is 2 things I absolutely require for my skincare.</p>

<DL>
<DT>COOLA - Classic SPF 30 Cucumber Moisturizer for Face</DT>
<DD>Deluxe sample 0.24 fl.oz./7 ml, $4.52</DD>
</DL>

<p>Coola and Supergoop are my go-tos for sunscreen -their both oxybenzone free (which is a must for me). This sunblock is made with 70 percent certified organic ingredients and protects from both UVA and UVB rays. The scent smells like fresh cucumbers which is refreshing on a hot summer day, plus it goes on smooth and not thick, another reason why I love this sunscreen.</p>

<DL>
<DT>Marcelle - Waterproof Eyeliner in <i>Electric Blue</i></DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size (2/3 of the full size pencil) 0.8g, $7.33</DD>
</DL>

<p>Wow, this color is definitely electric blue. Although I have blue eyeliners in my collection, it's not my favorite color to wear especially when its not dark, so I'm not sure I'll be using this anytime soon. I liked the color in my other box which was dark blue, but sadly this one was a miss for me.</p>

<DL>
<DT>Beauty Protector - Protect & Detangle</DT>
<DD>Deluxe sample 1 oz., $2.75</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've had this in my Birchbox before and although the scent is not for me, it does its job in detangling, moisturizing and heat protection. It’s also sulfate and paraben free which makes it totally safe for color treated hair.</p>

<H4><i class="icon-gift"></i> Bonus item:</H4>

<DL>
<DT>Emi Jay Solid Hair Tie in <i>Blue</i></DT>
<DD>1 hair tie, $2.20</DD>
</DL>

<p>I got a different of hair tie last week in my first Birchbox for this month, and I'm happy I got a different type! I'm beginning to sense that my items have a "blue" theme to it since my eyeliner was blue, the coola is blue, and now this hair tie too.</p>
<p>I love hair ties like this since it looks chic and doesn't snag or tangle my hair. I also love the fact that Emi-Jay donates 20% of all profitct to charity, plus its made in LA, my hometown!</p>

# Birchbox Plus Item

<center><img src='/images/BirchboxJune2015BPlusItem.jpg'></center>

<DL>
<DT>rumbaTIME Orchard Gloss in Rose Smoke</DT>
<DD>$28 to add on ($45 value)</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm in love with this watch! The color is pastel light pink, and it looks gorgeous on my wrist, and at a value price too! I've been wearing it on ever since I opened the box today and can't seem to take it off, my wrist just doesn't want to part with it #truestory.</p>
<p>I have really small wrists so I was concerned it would be too big for me, but it fits perfectly on the very last hole with some room for movement.</p>
<p>I'm already planning on expanding my collection of rumbaTime watches. Next target, the <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/shop/rumbatime-orchard-gem" target="_blank">Orchard Gem in Black</a> (and maybe White too).

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> VERDICT:</b> This box had a summer theme going on and perfume sample aside, I'll be using every item in it. I've already put all the items (beside the perfume) into my travel beauty bag so that it's all ready for me to use when I decide to head off to the beach or go on a vacay to somewhere sunny and tropical. The total value of this box came up to $24.40, that's if my calculations on the perfume sample are correct. But even if it's off by a dollar or two, the value is still double the cost so I'm happy with that, plus <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Birchbox</a> got brownie points for including the hair tie as a bonus item!</p>
