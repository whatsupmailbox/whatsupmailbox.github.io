# Birchbox Items

<p>This box has motivated me to plan my next vacation and fill it with adventure! I've already narrowed down my destination to two places, so its progress =)</p>

<p>Just like I mentioned in <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Birchbox-June-2015-Review/" target="_blank">my Birchbox review last week</a>, for June they included a sweepstake in each box. You see that card that says "You've got big plans..."? That's the sweepstake card and behind it is a code that you enter on their website to see what your prize is. You can enter your code <a href="http://www.birchbox.com/sayyes" target="_blank">here</a> and tell me what you won, I'm curious!</p>
<p>I entered my code and got a 10% off coupon. I got a 20% off coupon in my first box last week, so it's always kind of sad to get something less than what you're used to. I'd love to find out what others got with their codes, share please!</p>
<br>

<DT>Now let's move on to the products inside!</DT>

<p><center><img src='/images/BirchboxJune2015BItems2.jpg'></center></p>
<H4>My products:</H4>
<DL>
<DT>Skyn Iceland Hydro Cool Firming Eye Gels</DT>
<DD>1 treatment, Value $3.75</DD>
</DL>

<p>Eye gels are a life saver for my tired eyes and I've tried this specific one before thanks to Birchbox and it was ultra refreshing, so I'm happy I got it again.</p>

<DL>
<DT>Supergoop! - Everyday Sunscreen SPF 50</DT>
<DD>Deluxe sample 0.34 fl.oz./10 ml, $2.69</DD>
</DL>

<p>I have Supergoop! products but I'm happy to add more to my collection especially in these small travel friendly tubes, they're so convenient. This sunscreen can be used for both body and face and is oil-free, plus it's free of oxybenzone.</p>

<DL>
<DT>Number 4 - Super Comb Prep & Protect</DT>
<DD>Deluxe sample 30 ml/1 fl.oz., $4.80</DD>
</DL>

<p>I just got this 2 months ago from Birchbox so I think it might be time for me to update my profile. This sulfate-free leave-in conditioner will protect your hair from heat damage and it also doubles as a color protector and UV shield. The size of the bottle is also travel friendly and perfect to bring to the beach or poolside.</p>

<DL>
<DT>Marcelle - Waterproof Eyeliner in <i>Indigo</i></DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size (2/3 of the full size pencil) 0.8g, $7.33</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm glad that the color of this eyeliner is dark and although not black (it's like a dark blue), it still fits me well. It still looks black on me with a tiny hint of blue but very slightly. I also appreciate that this is waterproof and almost full size (2/3 of full size).</p>

<DL>
<DT>Catherine Malandrino - Style de Paris Eau de Parfum</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Spray 2ml?, $4.33?</DD>
</DL>

<i><small>There was no information on size for this item, so my calculations are based on average perfume sample spray sizes.</small></i>
<p>Fragrance samples never excite me. I get way too many from my online beauty purchases as free gifts, plus I think scents are so personal that its hard to please anyone, especially me since I'm very picky with my fragrances.</p>
<p>"This scent from fashion designer Catherine Malandrino hits all the right notes with a playful yet sophisticated oriental fragrance mixed with fun fruits (think: Italian Mandarin, ruby red grapefruit, and Nashi pear). Like her renowned, sought-after designs, it’s the perfect blend of chic Parisian style and the infectious energy of New York City."</p>

# Birchbox Plus Item

<center><img src='/images/BirchboxJune2015PlusItem.jpg'></center>

<DL>
<DT>rumbaTIME Orchard Gloss in Rose Smoke</DT>
<DD>$28 to add on ($45 value)</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm in love with this watch! The color is pastel light pink, and it looks gorgeous on my wrist, and at a value price too! I've been wearing it on ever since I opened the box today and can't seem to take it off, my wrist just doesn't want to part with it #truestory.</p>
<p>I have really small wrists so I was concerned it would be too big for me, but it fits perfectly on the very last hole with some room for movement.</p>
<p>I'm already planning on expanding my collection of rumbaTime watches. Next target, the <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/shop/rumbatime-orchard-gem" target="_blank">Orchard Gem in Black</a> (and maybe White too).

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> VERDICT:</b> This box had a summer theme going on and perfume sample aside, I'll be using every item in it. I've already put all the items (beside the perfume) into my travel beauty bag so that it's all ready for me to use when I decide to head off to the beach or go on a vacay to somewhere sunny and tropical. The total value of this box came up to $24.40, that's if my calculations on the perfume sample are correct. But even if it's off by a dollar or two, the value is still double the cost so I'm happy with that, plus <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Birchbox</a> got brownie points for including the hair tie as a bonus item!</p>
