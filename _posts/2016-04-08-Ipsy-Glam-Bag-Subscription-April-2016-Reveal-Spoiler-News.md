<p><a href="https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d" target="_blank">Ipsy</a> reveals are available now so you can see what you'll be getting this month in your Glam Bag.</p>

<p>You'll need to share on social media though to access this early peek, so I did with mine and here's what I'll be getting this month:</p>

</a></center>

<ul>The items are (from top left to right):

<li>tarte cosmetics - LipSurgence™ lip crème in wonder</li>
<li>Ipsy April 2016 Bag</li>
<li>Luxie Beauty - Dreamcatcher Tapered Highlighter Brush 522</li>
<li>Pretty Woman - Nail Polish in Pouty</li>
<li>City Color Cosmetics - Highlight Trio</li>
<li>TULA - Exfoliating Treatment Mask</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>I always love getting beauty tools in my Ipsy bags so I was delighted to see a highlighter brush especially since I'll also be getting a highlight trio palette, how thoughful. I honestly can say that I'm excited about my bag this month!</p>
