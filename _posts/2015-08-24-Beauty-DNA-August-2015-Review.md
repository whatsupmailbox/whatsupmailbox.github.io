<p><b>Subscription:</b> <a href="https://www.beautydna.com/" target="_blank">Beauty DNA</a></p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $25/monthly + Free Shipping</p>
<p><b>Shipping:</b> Free. </p>
<p><b>What's in the box:</b> One FULL SIZED beauty product that's matched to your "Beauty Profile" that you complete upon signing up.</p>
<br>

<p>This is my first box from Beauty DNA so I was super excited when I finally got it in the mail!</p>
<p>I purchased a deal from Ruelala (it's no longer available) a couple of months back but only got around to redeeming it this month. It's a completely different experience than other beauty subscriptions since everyone gets a different full-sized product that matched with their skin concerns/needs.</p>
<p>When you join, there's a "Beauty Profile" that they make you complete and below are just a couple of examples of what they are:</p>

<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNAAugust2015Profile1.png'></center></p>
<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNAAugust2015Profile2.png'></center></p>

<p>There's 14 pages of these questions and although that might seem to many, think of it as a consultation with your doctor - the more you let them know about you, the more they can help you out. It didn't take me long at all to complete it and I also like the fact that you can access your Beauty Profile anytime and modify it if you ever have any changes in your skincare needs.</p>

<H4>Based on my Beauty Profile, here is the item they matched me with:</H4>

<p>I've never heard of this brand before, but I'm always up for a toner so that was a relief. To be honest, I was quite worried that they'd match me with something completely off of my profile due to experiences with other subscriptions, but I think this will work just fine.</p>

<p>Beauty DNA also included a detailed Beauty Report about the product and why they matched it for you. It also includes the value, where to purchase, and who you're beauty specialist is.</p>

<p>I love this Beauty Report, it feels so personalized and informational too!</p>

# Extra Item

<p>Because I purchased this Beauty DNA subscription through Ruelala, the deal also included one extra product with every box. So here's my extra product:</p>

<p>OMG, I just got a sample of this cleanser from my August 2015 Birchbox (a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Birchbox-Subscription-Box-August-2015-Review-Coupon/" target="_blank">read my review here</a>) and totally loved it so I was ecstatic when I saw I got a full-sized version of this in my Beauty DNA box, thank you thank you thank you! I was already planning on buying it after finishing my sample, so this totally saved my $35, yay!</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I'm in love with Beauty DNA! They did a great job at matching me with a product that I need and the value is totally there, especially with the extra item too! And if I had to be completely honest, I actually love the bonus item more than the matched item which makes this box an absolute slam dunk for me. If you're tired of sample sizes, try Beauty DNA and </p>
