<p><a href="https://www.fivefourclub.com/getstarted?referrer=RE731318" target="_blank">Five Four Club</a> is a great subscription for men who don't have time to shop or need the extra fashion help to bump up their style. I find their products to be of high quality and their style on trend. My husband loves them!</p>

<p>When you subscribe, you'll take a profile survey to input your size and style preferences. My husband selected "Fashion Forward" as his style with a preference in vibrant rich colors. There are 4 options in style; Classic, Casual, Fashion Forward or a Mix of all.</p>

<H4>Based on my husband's "Fashion Forward" profile, here is what they sent:</H4>

<p>This sweater looks just like it's pictured, quite plain in my opinion and definitely not fashion forward. My husband will still wear this though since the material is not too thick so it'll be okay for our warm winter here in California.</p>

<p>A closer look at the collar area shows a yellow lining inside. Too bad there wasn't any of this color on the outside to make this sweater somewhat interesting.</p>

<p>Although my husband loves getting their shirts, this one is again plain in style. What's going on here?! I double checked the profile I submitted in my account and it definitely says "Fashion Forward". I think this fits more towards the "Classic" style. So disappointed.</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This has got to be the first time that I'm disappointed in my Five Four Club items. It was a case of mistaken style as I'm pretty sure the 2 items I received fit more towards the "Classic" style and not the "Fashion Forward" style. They even have pictures of models wearing outfits to represent each style when you fill out your online profile, and even with that it looks more towards the "Classic" style. I wouldn't have bought these 2 items myself if I went shopping, so needless to say, this really bummed me out. I'm going to give them another try next month to see what they send and I'll decide then if I'll continue subscribing. Here's to hoping they do a better job!</p>
