**Sticker Sheets in Exclusive Designs** (5 sheets)

The girl stickers are adorable and so cute! I love them! It looks very summery, the colors are bright and cheerful, I can't wait to use them in my planner!

<br>

![The Planner Society July 2016 Items](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/The-Planner-Society-Kit-July-2016-Journal-Cards.jpg)

**Journal Cards**

These cards are great for journaling, scrapbooking, and card making. You can also stick it onto your current dashboard or planner divider to decorate it more. I'm still new to journaling cards so I will have to play around with what I will use this for.

<br>

![The Planner Society July 2016 Items](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/The-Planner-Society-Kit-July-2016-Die-Cuts.jpg)

**Die Cuts**

These die cuts are so adorable! They match the stickers and you can use these as embellishments to your planner, your card making project, and many more.

<br>

![The Planner Society July 2016 Items](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/The-Planner-Society-Kit-July-2016-Folder-Tabs-Stickers.jpg)

**Word Stickers & Folder Tabs**

I like using these word stickers as a title in my daily schedule or on my to do list in my planner. The folder tabs are pretty and will definitely get use as well.

<br>

![The Planner Society July 2016 Items](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/The-Planner-Society-Kit-July-2016-Washi-Tapes.jpg)

**Washi Tapes** (2 rolls)

Love love love the girl washi tape, ahhhh, I die! I'm going to use this on just about anything it will stick to, lol. The yellow floral one is nice and pretty too, but the girl, I think it might just be my favorite item in this box!

<br>

Here's how it looks on paper:

It looks so good on paper, just gorgeous!

<br>

![The Planner Society July 2016 Items](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/The-Planner-Society-Kit-July-2016-Stamps.jpg)

**Stamps**

These are stamps that you put on acryclic blocks and put them back on this sheet when not in use. I prefer these as they don't take much space versus the ones that are attached to a wooden block individually.

<br>

**Mason Jar Notepad**

What a cute little notepad! I love mason jars.

<br>

**Crown Pen**

I love cute and pretty pens, you can never have enough pens especially with me where I need one pretty much everywhere around the house.

<br>

![The Planner Society July 2016 Items](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/The-Planner-Society-Kit-July-2016-Crown-Pen-02.jpg)

The crown barrel upclose shows the design as well as the pearl on the clicker. This pen looks great and writes well too!

<br>

![The Planner Society July 2016 Items](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/The-Planner-Society-Kit-July-2016-Pen-Refills.jpg)

Refills for the pen were included in the box, 3 refills to be exact. How thoughtful and definitely much appreciated! This way I can continue using the pen versus throwing it away when the ink is done.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** This box is amazing! Since this is my first ever box from them, I don't have much to compare it with, but I do know that I loved everything and will totally be using it asap in my planner and paper projects. The designs are gorgeous and so beautifully done, and it fits perfectly with my style. What I love most is that these designs are exclusive to The Planner Society subscribers, so you won't see them being sold anywhere else. I can't believe I didn't subscribe earlier, but I'm so happy I finally did and I can't wait for next month's box! FYI, the theme for next month was revealed to be "Nautical". 

Interested in subscribing? You can [go to their website](http://www.scarletlime.com/plannersociety15.html){:target="_blank"} to start receiving their monthly planner boxes! FYI, they take official signups from the 2nd - 14th of each month.
