<p><b>Subscription:</b> <a href="https://gentlemansbox.com" target="_blank">Gentleman's Box</a></p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $25/monthly + Free Shipping to USA. $8 shipping to Canada.</p>
<p><b>What's in the box:</b> Four to six hand-selected products for men, accompanied by the latest issue of GQ Magazine (U.S. and Canada only).</p>

<p>Men's subscription boxes are quite few to find so I love it when I get the opportunity to review one. It's such a treat!</p>

<p>My husband can never have enough socks so it's always a happy day when they come in my subscription boxes. The design is simple yet the bright magenta color makes it pop out with any outfit.</p>

<p>A classic tie bar is a must in any gentleman's wardrobe and this is just that. It's simple, classic and will perfectly fit with any tie.</p>

<p>These straight bottomed ties are so chic and modern, my husband has been wearing more of these styles lately and they just look so dapper. This tie is a modern version of your classic black tie and it will surely make you look like you're up to date with style. Plus the tie bar looks great together with this tie (as pictured), great combo!</p>
