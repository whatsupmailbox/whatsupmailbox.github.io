<p>I love my FabFitFun subscription, and the fact that they ship super fast, Priority Mail 1-day! It's always a treat to open this baby up and find what goodies lies within. I do wish they'd bump it up and become a monthly box instead, that way I get to repeat this happy feeling every month instead of waiting till next season for the next box. Pretty please!</p>

<p>Did I tell you how much I love opening my FabFitFun boxes, it brings out the giddy child in me!</p>

<p>I've seen some spoilers prior to receiving this box (one of them being the speakers), but even after that fact, it's a different feeling when you have it on hand. It's almost as if you never saw the spoiler (well somewhat), if you get what I mean.</p>

<H4>And here are the items inside:</H4>

<p>These items are sooo perfect for summer and a day on the beach, in the park, or wherever your summer heart leads you. Love it!</p>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

<center><img src="/images/FabFitFunSummer2015Lip.jpg"></center>
<p>I'm a Tarte fan, been for years and will be for years to come. They're a great cosmetic brand with healthy ingredients which is a must for me. I already own a lot of their lip products so I was happy to receive another one and in a color that I don't have too, thanks FabFitFun!</p>
<p>This lip gloss is in the color of "True Love" and it gives a pretty rich bright red color that's both semi-sheer and glossy. It does have a bit of a sting sensation upon application, but I love it since it let's me know that it's puckering my lips to a plumped up look, which is always welcomed.</p>
<br>

<center><img src="/images/FabFitFunSummer2015Speakers2.jpg"></center>
<p>I love listening to music wherever I go and whatever I do, it just keeps me sane and happy. I don't think people will appreciate me otherwise. Plus these speakers are in pink, totally me and totally in love with it. I tested it out right away and the sound quality is pretty good considering the price point. Of course I wasn't expecting Bose sound quality (and neither should you), but it does a pretty good job in terms of bluetooth music streaming.</p>
<p>Pairing was super easy and I also like the fact that you can charge through the included usb cable (no batteries needed here). The only thing I had a wee bit of issue with was that everytime you turn it on there would be an announcement from the device itself and it's actually pretty loud. It's a female voice that says "Bluetooth On!" You can change the volume setting for your music of course, just not the announcement which again is pretty loud. So that's my only gripe about it, nothing too big.</p>
<br>

<center><img src="/images/FabFitFunSummer2015Sponge.jpg"></center>
<p>I've been getting quite a lot of sponges in my subscription boxes lately. I'm not surprised since they are the "it" tool right now for skin cleansing. I like that it's a konjac sponge, I find the benefits matching my skin's needs so I'm happy to use this.</p>
<br>

<p>So it's been quite a long time since I've actually used jump ropes, I think the last time was when I was in elementary, yikes! But I guess now is a good time as any to start using them again, especially since they're pink. I just can't say no to pink stuff, it's my kryptonite. I'm also super happy that these ropes match my speakers, so using them both together will make me look fashionably coordinated, yay!</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I loved this box! I think it's a great combination of beauty, fitness, and lifestyle, plus it matched the summer theme pretty well. The only item I wasn't too impressed with were the nail scratch-ons, but that's just me and I might speak for the minority here. Everything else I loved and will be using till they can't be used anymore. The total value came up to $XXX and I'm super happy with that value. I think they've been stepping up their game lately with the items and I'm looking forward to their Fall box!</p>
