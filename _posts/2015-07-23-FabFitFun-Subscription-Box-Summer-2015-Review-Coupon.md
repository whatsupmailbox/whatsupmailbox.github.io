<p><b>Coupon:</b> Use coupon code <a href="http://fabfitfun-vip.evyy.net/c/164125/63686/1731" target="_blank">SUMMER20</a> to get $20 off the Summer 2015 box!</p>

<p>I love my FabFitFun subscription, it's always a treat to open this baby up! I do wish they'd bump it up and become a monthly box instead, that way I get to repeat this happy feeling every month instead of waiting till next season for the next box. Pretty please!</p>

<p>Did I tell you how much I love opening my FabFitFun boxes, it brings out the giddy child in me ;)</p>

<p>I've seen some spoilers prior to receiving this box (one of them being the speakers), but even after that fact, it's a different feeling when you have it on hand. It's almost as if you never saw the spoiler (well somewhat), if you get what I mean.</p>

<H4>And here are the items inside:</H4>

<p>These items are sooo perfect for summer and a day on the beach, in the park, or wherever your summer heart leads you. Love it!</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I loved this box! I think it's a great combination of beauty, fitness, and lifestyle, plus it matched the summer theme pretty well. The only item I wasn't too impressed with were the nail scratch-ons, but that's just me and I might speak for the minority here. Everything else I loved and will be using till they can't be used anymore. The total value came up to $XXX and I'm super happy with that value. I think they've been stepping up their game lately with the items and I'm looking forward for their Fall box!</p>
