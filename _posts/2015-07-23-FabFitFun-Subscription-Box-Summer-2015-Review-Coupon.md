<p>I love my FabFitFun subscription, it's always a treat to open this baby up! I do wish they'd bump it up and become a monthly box instead, that way I get to repeat this happy feeling every month instead of waiting till next season for the next box. Pretty please!</p>

<p>Did I tell you how much I love opening my FabFitFun boxes, it brings out the giddy child in me ;)</p>

<p>I've seen some spoilers prior to receiving this box (one of them being the speakers), but even after that fact, it's a different feeling when you have it on hand. It's almost as if you never saw the spoiler (well somewhat), if you get what I mean.</p>

<H4>And here are the items inside:</H4>

<p>These items are sooo perfect for summer and a day on the beach, in the park, or wherever your summer heart leads you. Love it!</p>
