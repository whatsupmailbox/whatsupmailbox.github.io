<p>I purchased the "Spring Clearing box from Rosario Dawson" during their wharehouse sale which means I got it for 50% off, steal!</p>
<p>Ever since it came out I was contemplating yet secretly wanting to get the box, and I'm glad I was tardy because now I saved some cash. #winning</p>

<p>First look at unboxing and Rosario Dawson is saying "Hello".</p>

<center><img src="/images/RosarioDawsonSpring2015Info.jpg"></center>
<p>Quarterly Co. is different where they don't just include an info card, they actually provide a personal letter type of info card where the curator explains the choices in the box and what they mean to the theme. I like it, it's both informational and personal, nice touch!</p>

<H4>And here are the items:</H4>

<p>This box had so many items inside, awesome!</p>

<DT><a href="http://studiooneeightynine.com" target="_blank">Studio One Eighty Nine</a> Pillow Case</DT>
<DD>Value $75</DD>
</DL>
<p>I love the pattern of this pillow case! I only wished there was a pair, so I'm working on getting another one to make it a set, but in the meantime, it's already on my bed and it looks so urban cool.</p>
<p>This pillow case was designed and Handmade in Ghana using traditional African Wax, how cool is that. A great product that's also doing great in the world.</p>
<p>Although I wouldn't necessarily pay $75 for this, I'm happy this was included in the box and I would never have obtained one if it weren't for it, so for that I'm grateful.</p>

<DD>Value $23.40</DD>
</DL>
<p>Not only do I love this necklace, I love what it represents and supports -to never give up and to support research for cancer.</p>
<p>The multi-colored tone of silver, gold and rose gold plating reminds me that we are all uniquely different and yet we can stand together for one purpose. I think this is a great necklace to be included in this box as it reminds us that while we are spring cleaning, we too must revisit our inner self and cleanse of our negativity and move towards a positive and meaningful future. But don't mind me, that's just what I thought of this necklace ;)</p>

<DD>Demi Vanity Tin 3.17oz/90g, Value $10</DD>
</DL>
<p>This candle smells amazingly fresh, oh my, I can't get enough! I'm always skeptical with candles because I'm quite picky with scents, but this was a perfect match for me, yay!</p>
<p>Made with soy wax then blended with essential oils and an all cotton-wick makes this candle a slam dunk for me.</p>

<DD>9.3 fl. oz., Value $6.95</DD>
</DL>
<p>Naturally eliminate odors & refresh fabrics without the use of harsh, synthetic chemicals or masking agents. Leaves nothing behind but the refreshing scent of essential oils & botanicals!</p>
<p>I'm subscribed to their Essentials Bundle (<a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Honest-Company-Essentials-Bundle-June-2015-Review/" target="_blank"> you can read my June 2015 review here</a>), and I actually ordered the Lemon Verbana scent in my last box so I was happy to get another scent. I love this air freshener because it's natural which is important for something that you put into the air you breathe. The scent is sweet yet refreshing and I'm happy that I have 2 now!</p>

<DT><a href="http://www.rishi-tea.com/product/thai-celadon-ceramic-teacup/teacups" target="_blank">Thai Celadon Tea Cup</a></DT>
<DD>One Tea Cup, Value $5</DD>
</DL>
<p>This is another item that I wish it came in pairs. I'm happy with the one, but I don't think I can use it with company in case jealousy might arise. So, naturally I shall be buying another cup (or two or three) to complete the set.</p>
<p>This tea cup is free of toxic heavy metals such as lead oxide, cadmium, glass and boric oxide which are commonly used in modern pottery. Only natural materials such as wood, herb and tea ash, weathering stone, surface clay and limestone are used in our 100% natural glazes.</p>
<p>The only drawback is that it's hand wash only and you can't use soap or detergent on it, and no microwave as well. I hope I remember that and not accidently wash it or nuke it. Fingers crossed.</p>

<DD>One pair, Value $8.50</DD>
</DL>
<p>Unique is one word to describe these socks. I love the color pink so that's a good start, but the design I'm not so sure. But I'm happy to wear these socks at home.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=728614&u=1115177&m=54558&urllink=&afftrack=" target="_blank">Sock Panda</a> is a (funkly and cool) sock subscription that sends out 1 or 2 pairs of socks monthly. And for every subscription, they donate a pair of socks to the homeless -they've donated 10,000+ socks so far!</p>

<DT><a href="http://www.ceedproject.com/shop/blue-silver/" target="_blank">CEED Beads in Blue & Silver</DT>
<DD>Value $40</DD>
<p>Although the value seems pretty high (I don't think I would ever pay $40 for a bracelet like this), it does go towards creating jobs for women in Africa. CEED employs local village women in Ghana to make these popular and unique CEED Beads. So with that knowledge, I'm happy to have received this.</p>
<p>Each box had a different color of CEED beads, and although blue is not my favorite color, at least it's dark blue so I can wear it. Here's what Blue symbolizes from their website: Blue â€“ symbolizes knowledge, healing, peace, truth and harmony. Blue is a cooling color that encourages faith, devotion and deep insight.</p>

<DD>One sachet of loose tea, Value $2?</DD>
</DL>
<p>I'm so happy that this is an herbal tea! This tea is a blend of Lemon Myrtle, Vebena, Mint, Rooibos and Roses. Because I'm sensitive to caffeine, Rooibos has been my go-to tea in the morning and this blend is perfect for me. It ta</p>
