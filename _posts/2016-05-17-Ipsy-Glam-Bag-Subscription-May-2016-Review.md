<p><b>Subscription:</b> <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d" target="_blank">Ipsy</a></p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $10/monthly + Free Shipping</p>
<p><b>What's in the box:</b> You'll receive 4-5 mix of full-sized and deluxe-sized beauty products tailored to you in a collectible bag. You complete a beauty profile upon joining and the products you'll receive will be matched based on that. You can update this profile any time and you'll also be able to review the products you receive for points which you can redeem towards a selection of beauty items.</p>

<br>

<p>Ipsy always ships their bags in bright neon pink padded envelopes, it's hard to miss and I always get happy when I see it in my mailbox!</p>

<p>Ipsy is very similar to <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Birchbox</a> where all subscribers receive different variations in their bag, and is mostly dependent on the answers you give in the Ipsy beauty quiz. They try to give you products that match your needs and concerns so not everyone will get the same items. And you can retake the beauty quiz at anytime if you feel that the products didn't really match you.</p>

<p>This review is for my profile so it's just one of the many variations that they sent out.</p>

<br>

<p>Every month <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d" target="_blank">Ipsy</a> sends their items in makeup bags with an exclusive design. This month's design has a travel theme and includes icons of landmarks around the world.</p>

<p>Here's a closer look at the bag:</p>

</a></center>

<br>

<p>Every bag also includes a card with the theme of this month's glam bag. And since this month's theme is Destination Chic, they've put a postcard with a greetings message for all ipsters to fill out and mail back.<p>

<p>"This shimmering trio of ipsy-curated shades includes Crush (beige), Skinny Dip (copper) and Lovely (brown). These richly pigmented, velvety-smooth eye shadows complement each other for a subtle yet glitzy everyday eye look."</p>

<p>I love getting eyeshadow palettes, especially when the colors can be worn with an everyday look, so no complaints here!</p>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Smashbox</b> X-Rated Mascara</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size, Value $5?</DD>
</DL>

<p>This mascara was created on set in their LA photo studio to be their most buildable mascara. You can wear it for natural voluminous lashes or layer it on for dramatic and over-the-top volume. Their Triple Threat brush features three deep channels for mega-coating lashes and three rows of bristles that isolate, amplify and extend each lash.</p>

<p>I'm very picky with my mascaras as I have specific needs for my thin and sparse lashes. I've tried this mascara before and it was just ok, at least for me.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>The Organic Pharmacy</b> Antioxidant Lip Balm</DT>
<DD>Full Size .24 fl oz, Value $22</DD>
</DL>

<p>So a lip balm for $22 sounds pretty insane especially when it comes in a not-so-big tube. I'm trying to compare this with the size of the sugar lip balm from FRESH and it just doesn't compare. Plus, I'm super suspicious and non-trusting when it comes to products made in PRC a.k.a. Peoples Republic of China.</p>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Etat Libre d'Orange</b>Remarkable People Fragrance</DT>
<DD>Travel Spray 5 ml., Value $12</DD>
</DL>

<p>This exact travel spray is sold in Sephora for $12 so although I'm not big on receiving fragrance samples, this size is pretty substantial and it comes in a spray bottle too so I'm actually quite happy.</p>

<p>Inspired by and created for heroes large and small, Remarkable People is a salute to those who defy convention and challenge the status quo to change the world around them. Bright citrus top notes forge ahead leading a warm heart of spicy florals laid over a grounding base of soft woods.</p>

<p><b>Notes:</b> Grapefruit, Champagne Accord, Cardamom, Jasmine, Curry Je, Black Pepper, Labdanum, Sandalwood, Lorenox.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Hikari Cosmetics</b> Shimmer Bronzer in Radiate</DT>
<DD>Full Size, Value $17</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm all about contouring and a bronzer is a must have for that. I'm happy to receive this item because of that, but this specific bronzer does have quite a bit of shimmer in it. I prefer mine to be matte so sadly this will be gifted.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I've had quite good luck in my Ipsy bags lately but this month was a bit disappointing. I think I'll only be using 2 out of the 5 items, and although the value of those 2 items alone go past the cost of this subscription, it's still kind of a bummer. But oh well, at least I got double my money's worth which is not bad at all. I'm thinking I need to update my beauty profile to see if that will help for next month's glam bag, hopefully that will do the trick. Fingers crossed.</p>
