[Emma & Chloe](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"} is a French jewelry subscription box that ships 1 jewelry item every month that's made in France. They initially only shipped to Europe but started shipping to U.S. this year (so happy when that happened!). And since I love everything French, I subscribed in a heartbeat!

When you first subscribe, you'll be prompted to answer a couple of questions regarding your jewelry preferences.

Their boxes used to ship through DHL, but this month they've changed it to USPS. I find that it arrived sooner (I'm in Los Angeles) and the envelopes now are poly mailers. The previous packaging were padded envelopes but they are still white and unmarked so it's safe from prying eyes.

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaEtChloeAugust2016OpenPackage.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}

First look at unpacking and you see a separate bubble wrap inside to keep your box in perfect condition.

<br>

And you finally see the box inside the bubble wrap! I love their boxes, I have quite a few now and display them on my bookcase. They are totally reusable and so unique, different than any other boxes out there.

<br>

The box opens up like a book and inside you see their jewelry bag as well as their info magazine, "La Gazette".

<br>

**The Info Magazine, La Gazette:**

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaEtChloeAugust2016InfoMagazine.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}

Their Info Magazine is quite thick and full of useful details as you'll see in the pics below.

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaEtChloeAugust2016InfoMagazine02.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}

The first page is their Table of Contents. So many useful contents!

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaEtChloeAugust2016InfoMagazine03.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}

A section on the designer of this month's jewelry describes the background and history of the brand, as well as his inspiration and future plans.

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaEtChloeAugust2016InfoMagazine06.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}

I always love their fashion section, and this month focuses on the 4 must-wear summer outfits that's trending right now.

<br>

Some cocktail recipes, yum! The watermelon one looks super delish and so refreshing, I need to make that soon!

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaEtChloeAugust2016JewelryBag.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}

[Emma & Chloe](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"} sends their monthly jewelry pieces in these black drawstring bags. Because what good are your jewelry if it's not kept properly right? I'm not sure if they're anti tarnish, but they are super handy for when you need to travel and separate your jewels from scratching each other.

<br>

<H4>And here is this month's jewelry item:</H4>

[![Emma & Chloe August 2016 Item - Peter Hopper Petit Bateau Gold & Silver Ring](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaEtChloeAugust2016PeterHopperPetitBateauGoldSilverRings.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}

**Peter Hopper** Petit Bateau Ring in Silver or Gold, *Value $68*

Subscribers will receive this ring in either Silver or Gold, depending on their jewelry preferences. I received both as I have one personal subscription that I pay myself, and another one that's sponsored.

The ring's design is very geometric and modern. Totally my style, simple and classic with a modern twist.

<br>

Details of the ring in the info magazine:

Gold is actually my preferred metal of choice, but sometimes silver just looks better on certain outfits. FYI, when you complete your jewelry preferences, you can of course select gold or silver, but you can also have them surprise you instead of the same metal for every shipment.

The inside of the ring has the "Peter Hopper" logo and brand engraved on it and as you can see, the ring itself is adjustable, which I'm so thankful for since I have insanely super petite fingers.

<br>

Here's a closer look at the gold ring:

This ring is gold plated and was designed with the inspiration of origami, the Japanese art of paper folding. You probably know it best from the paper crane birds. Honestly at first I thought it looked more like Great Gatsby style, with the geometric and modern design, but once I read what inspired him to create this, it totally makes sense, I do see origami in this!

<br>

And here's a closer look at the silver ring:

The silver version is just as beautiful and can be worn everyday without making too much of a statement.

<br>

Both rings on me:

In love with the design on these rings, it almost looks a little bit like crowns don't you think? Which is fine by me =)

<br>

**Certificate of Authenticity:**

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** [Emma & Chloe](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"} is one of my most treasured subscription boxes that I truly enjoy receiving every month. It's always exciting to find out what they send and they never disappoint. What I love most is that I end up discovering amazing new jewelry lines that I never would have known if it wasn't for this box. It's hard enough for me to know every amazing jewelry designer here in the United States alone, so to discover French brands is even more difficult especially since most of their websites are in French and only deliver within Europe. Wearing a piece of French jewelry that I know not everyone has or that I would rarely see someone else wearing while I'm out and about gives me that extra boost of pride and confidence, it's just a special feeling. So thank you Emma & Chloe for delivering your amazing boxes to us here in America!

Interested in subscribing? Visit their [website](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"} to subscribe and start receiving French jewelry in your mailbox! And don't forget to use coupon code **WHATSUPBOX50** to get 50% off your first box! That brings the cost down to only $17.50 for a gorgeous French Jewelry item!
