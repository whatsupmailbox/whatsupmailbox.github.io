<p>Victory Box is a new men's accessories subscription box from the brand <a href="http://www.winnerscirclefashion.com" target="_blank">Winners Circle Fashion Co.</a> and this is their first launch box! It ships around the 10th of every month, and you'll need to subscribe before the 1st of the month to receive the upcoming month's box.</p>

<p>First off, I like how the box has the checkered pattern, it's so distinct and cool. It was a welcomed sight to find it in my mailbox. Now let's start unboxing!</p>

<p>I absolutely love it when I get a watch from a subscription box! It's such a treat!</p>

<p>The watch itself is simple yet it brightens up any outfit with it's red, white and blue strap. The strap is made of nylon material so it's lightweight and water resistant.<p>

<p>I love watch face dials that are clean in design, and the white color will surely go well for the summer fashion. I can't wait to wear this for 4th of July or even on my next trip to France ;)</p>

<p>Pocket squares totally adds an extra touch to your finished look. It's such a simple accessory and oh-so easy to wear, yet the end result makes you look from so-so to Oh Yeah!</p>

<p>This pocket square's design is great for those who are just beginning to wear them as the pattern is versatile and not too loud. Will go great with your summer blazer!</p>

<p>Red ties are a must have in any man's wardrobe. They look great no matter what your style is. And I love the red shade of this tie, it's both classic and modern. A great addition to any man's tie collection!</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I love the curation as well as the color scheme of this month's box. It has all the items a dapper man would need to complete his look! It can all be used together (thanks to their thoughtful color theme) or individually. The total value for this month's box came up to $92.99! And for $16, I must say, this is such an amazing deal. The watch itself is worth more than triple that amount, insanity. This is definitely a must have box for all you dapper men out there who's looking to add some pizaaz in your wardrobe or look!</p>
