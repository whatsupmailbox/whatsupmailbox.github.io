<p>Ipsy always ships their bags in bright neon pink padded envelopes, it's hard to miss and I always get happy when I see it in my mailbox!</p>

<p>Ipsy is very similar to <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Birchbox</a> where all subscribers receive different variations in their bag, and is mostly dependent on the answers you give in the Ipsy beauty quiz. They try to give you products that match your needs and concerns so not everyone will get the same items. And you can retake the beauty quiz at anytime if you feel that the products didn't really match you.</p>

<p>This review is for my profile so it's just one of the many variations that they sent out.</p>

<br>

<p>Every month <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d" target="_blank">Ipsy</a> sends their items in makeup bags with an exclusive design. This month's colors remind me of sunset or the desert, but that's just me.</p>

<p>Here's a look inside the bag:</p>

<p>Every bag also includes a card with the theme of this month's glam bag.<p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Tarte Cosmetics</b> LipSurgence Lip Cr√®me in Wonder</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Size .05 oz. (half of full size), Value $12</DD>
</DL>

<p>This lipstick is infused with their famous maracuja oil to leave lips feeling oh-so soft. Every subscriber who received this item will get the same shade, Wonder, a soft poppy pink shade.</p>

<p>I'm a fan of Tarte products and I have tons of their cheek and lip tints. Their colors are great and they stay on really well. Needless to say, I was super delighted to get this in my glam bag.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Tula</b> Exfoliating Treatment Mask</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Tube 0.5 oz., Value $16</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: This tube came with an inner seal.</i></p>

<p>"This dual phase skin mask provides both a chemical and physical exfoliation. Lactic Acid works to gently peel away dirt and debris while Bentonite Clay and plant-based microencapsulated beads (containing soybean oil, volcanic sand and Vitamin E ) gently slough off old, dead skin cells while also releasing a boost of extra hydration, which results in a polished, hydrated, glowing complexion.".</p>

<p>They recommend this mask for those who suffer from uneven skin tone and texture, dull and flaky skin, or loss of firmness. It's suitable for all skin types so I will surely be trying this out!</p>

<DT><b>Pretty Woman</b> Nail Polish in Pouty</DT>
<DD>Full Size, Value $7.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love getting nail polish in my Ipsy glam bags, it makes me venture out and try colors that I wouldn't have bought myself and most of the time I end up loving the colors too. Pouty is a fucshia lavender color. It's a very bright and vibrant color which goes well for summer so I can't complain.</p>

<p>Pretty Woman nail polishes are Made in the USA, and their formula is long-lasting (they say it will last up to 10 days) and 5-free as well, yay!</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>City Color Cosmetics</b>Highlight Trio</DT>
<DD>Deluxe Sample Palette 3 x .08 oz., Value $5?</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: This palette came sealed.</i></p>

<p>I'm all about contouring, so bronzers and highlighters are a must in my makeup routine. So I was more than happy to receive this highlighter trio.</p>

<p>This palette comes with 3 shimmer shades, plus they also work as eye shadows.</p>

<br>

<p>You can see how the colors look on different skin tones from the picture below that's posted on their website:</p>

<br>

<p>As you can see, you'll definitely find a shade that will complement your skin. Will definitely have to try this out soon!</p>

<DT><b>Luxie Beauty</b> Dreamcatcher Tapered Highlighter Brush 522</DT>
<DD>Full Size, Value $24</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love love love getting brushes from Ipsy. Sometimes they're a hit and sometimes a miss, but for the most part, I've been quite happy. I have a couple of Luxie brushes in my collection but not the highlighter #522 one so I'm happy with that, especially since it will go great to try out with the highlighter palette that's in this month's glam bag as well, how thoughtful!</p>

<p>The brush itself is quite big. It was actually packaged outside of the bag because it coudln't fit inside. I typically like my highlighter brushes on the smaller size as I like to precisely target where I want to apply the product, but it will surely work to highlight my cheeks which is where I'll try this brush out.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Wow, I'm beyond happy with my items this month! All the products were essentially my favorite type of products to get so I feel like I hit the jackpot here. And at $10 cost, who can beat that. The highlighter brush itself is worth $24! Hopefully my luck will repeat itself next month ;)</p>
