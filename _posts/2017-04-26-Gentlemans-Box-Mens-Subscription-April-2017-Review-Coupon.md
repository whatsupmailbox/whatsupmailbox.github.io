[![WCR Co. Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxApril2017WCRCoSocks.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

**WCR Co.** Socks, *Value $12*

This blue and yellow striped socks will go great with your summer jeans or shorts. It's made of 80% cotton, 17% polyester, and 3% elastane.

<br>

[![DAZI USA Neck Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxApril2017DaziUSANeckTie.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

**DAZI USA** Neck Tie, *Value $28*

My husband loves ties that are simple in design because it can easily accompany any suit or outfit. This one is just that. The grey and yellow diagonal stripes will be versatile in matching his shirts and it's also a style that can be dressed up or down.

<br>

[![My Suited Life - Fish Hook Tie Bar](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxApril2017MySuitedLifeFishHookTieBar.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

**My Suited Life** Fish Hook Tie Bar, *Value $19*

A fish hook tie bar, that's a first for my husband! This is actually a Gentleman's Box exclusive item so you won't see it sold on their website. It's definitely bold in style and fitting for this month's theme. 

<br>

[![Sunny Rebel Sunglasses](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxApril2017SunnyRebelSunglasses.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

**Sunny Rebel** Sunglasses, *Value $35*

Sunglasses, woohoo!! I love it when sub boxes sends these! The style is quite fitting for almost any gentleman, and it can certainly be worn for casual or even formal outdoor events (or indoor if you're rocking the celeb "I need to avoid flashing paparazzi lights" style).

<br>

[![Sunny Rebel Sunglasses](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxApril2017SunnyRebelSunglasses02.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

The frame is actually a tortoise design and you can see it more clearly from the side. It's definitely a trend in both women and men, so I'd say this is quite unisex and I just might have to borrow it some time!

<br>

[![Detroit Grooming Co. Body Wash](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxApril2017DetroitGroomingCoPeppermintShampooBodyWash.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

**Detroit Grooming Co.** Shampoo & Body Wash, *Travel Size*

These deluxe sample bottles of body wash comes in way handy when we're travelling and my husband appreciates it more coming from a men's skincare brand as the scent is tailored to him. 

This particular one is a Peppermint scent and can be used as a shampoo or body wash. It's refreshing and is perfect for spring/summer.

<br>

[![Lawrence Hunt Gift Card](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxApril2017LawrenceHuntGiftCard.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

**Lawrence Hunt $50 Gift Card**

Lawrence Hunt is a fashion brand that sells dress shirts for both men and women. This $50 gift card looks to have unique codes so it's not a generic discount coupon. Almost all the dress shirts cost $78, but they don't have much available for sale from what I see on their website. Either way, my husband may want to try them out. 

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** The hero item of this month's box is definitely the sunglasses! Everything else is useful and fitting to be included in a men's subscription box. Considering the nautical theme this month, which can be a bit hard to nail, I thought it was pretty good. The value you get is quadruple the cost you pay, and with Gentleman's Box, you can be sure that every month they always deliver way above the cost, that's for certain. So if you're wanting to try a sub box or gift one to that special man of yours (Father's Day is coming up!), this would probably be on the top of the list!
