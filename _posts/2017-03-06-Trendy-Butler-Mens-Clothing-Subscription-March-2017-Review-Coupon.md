[Trendy Butler](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"} is a subscription that delivers brand name and trendy menswear based on a style profile that you complete upon subscribing. Not only do they take your profile into consideration when selecting items for you, they also take into account your location to send you appropriate weather clothes, how awesome is that! And since my husband hates shopping, this subscription has been a life saver for him!

<br>

[![First look at unpacking](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/TrendyButlerMarch2017OpenPackage.jpg)](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"}

Trendy Butler sends their items in a thick brown paper envelope and when you open that, you see the items packaged neatly inside.

<br>

<H4>Based on my husband's profile, here is what they sent:</H4>

<h4>Items in detail:</h4>

[![Trendy Butler - Cohesive & Co. Red Checkered Button Down Shirt](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/TrendyButlerMarch2017CohesiveCoRedCheckeredButtonDownShirt.jpg)](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"}

**Cohesive & Co.** Red Checkered Button Down Shirt, *Value $112.50?*

I couldn't really find this style on their website or online, so I'm estimating the value based on their other button down shirts.

I've been getting this brand quite frequently in my packages, and my husband actually loves them so no complaints here!

<br>

Here's how it looks on:

<br>

The red checkered pattern style is certainly a classic to have, and it pairs really well with either blue or black jeans. This shirt had a "Sharp Fit", which is another name for slim fit, and since that's what my husband's profile stated, naturally it was a perfect fit.

[![Trendy Butler - Tailor Vintage Black Sweater](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/TrendyButlerMarch2017TailorVintageBlackSweater.jpg)](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"}

**Tailor Vintage** Black Sweater, *Value $98*

I'm not sure how they knew, but my husband wears a lot of black sweaters, so this was a perfect match to what my husband needs. Black sweaters just compliments any shirt and is great for layering, especially when you're dressing business casual, which is what he typically wears most of the time. Made of 100% cotton sweater, it's soft, comfy and also fitting. It's surely going to be his go-to sweater now!

<br>

And here's how it looks on:

This is totally my husband's type of style, casual and yet sophisticated. He loved the look so much, he wore it two days in a row! #truestory

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> What a great package this month delivered! The pairing of the checkered shirt and black sweater was just perfect and a total hit with my husband. One thing that I truly love about this subscription is how they send items that pair well together. And you know that they chose the items specifically for you and your profile, so it's like having your own stylist without the high service fee. It's been such a convenience for my husband, he doesn't have to think too much about what to wear on the days after receiving his Trendy Butler packages. Now if only they can send him a package every week! =)
