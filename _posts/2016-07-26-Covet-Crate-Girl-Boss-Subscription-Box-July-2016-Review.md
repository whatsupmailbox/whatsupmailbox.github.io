**Subscription:** [Covet Crate](http://www.covetcrate.com){:target="_blank"}

**Cost:** $94.95/bi-monthly for the Lady Boss OR $54.95/bi-monthly for the Girl Boss + Free Shipping.

**What's in the box:** Items include things such as: office supplies and accessories, stationery, office decor, style accessories, beauty and skincare items, office snacks, books, discounts (on things such as business/life coaching, classes, etc.), and anything else that may empower, motivate, inspire, and encourage you!

<br>

I've only subscribed to them recently and this will be my second box that I've reviewed. The last box wasn't too exciting for me ([you can read that review here](http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Covet-Crate-Girl-Boss-Subscription-Box-May-2016-Review/){:target="_blank"}) so I'm hoping this one will be better!

<br>

**This review is for the "Girl Boss" box.

<br>

![First unboxing look](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016OpenBox.jpg)

First look at unboxing shows the items inside are wrapped with tissue paper and finished off with a black bowtie.

<br>

![Second unboxing look](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016OpenBox2.jpg)

Once you unwrap the tissue paper, you see their info magazine and a lot of bubble wrap to keep your items safe from damage during shipment.

<br>

<H4>The Info Magazine:</H4>

![Covet Crate Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016Info.jpg)

Every box includes an Info Magazine that spotlights a woman/lady figure who is an inspiration to others through their work or achievement. This month they featured Marie Curie.

<br>

![Covet Crate Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016Info2.jpg)

Inside you'll find the Table of Contents.

<br>

![Covet Crate Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016Info3.jpg)

They detail each item that was included in the box as well as a description of not only the items itself, but also the company and/or artist behind it.

<br>

<H4>And here are all the items inside the box:</H4>

![Covet Crate Girl Boss July 2016 Items](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016Items.jpg)

I love florals and I love gold, so I'm super happy about the items so far, plus they look so pretty!

<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

![Rosanna Jet Setter Tray Hello Beautiful](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016RosannaJetSetterTrayHelloBeautiful.jpg)

**Rosanna** Jet Setter Tray Hello Beautiful. *Value $22*

*Dimensions: 4.25" x 6.25"*

<br>

I'm a big fan of Rosanna and have quite a bit of their items in my collection. Their designs are always so pretty and chic, this one included.

<br>

![Rosanna Jet Setter Tray Hello Beautiful](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016RosannaJetSetterTrayHelloBeautiful2.jpg)

The "Hello Beautiful" message is uplifting and the colors are happy and bright. I'm putting this on top of my entryway console to welcome me when I come home!

<br>

![Rifle Paper Co. Jardin De Paris Memoir Notebook](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016RiflePaperCoJardinDeParisMemoirNotebook.jpg)

**Rifle Paper Co.** Jardin De Paris Memoir Notebook. *Value $15*

Another great company that I'm a fan of. They're famous for their floral designs and oh how pretty they are indeed! I don't have this particular pattern so I'm happy to add this to my collection.

<br>

![Rifle Paper Co. Jardin De Paris Memoir Notebook](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016RiflePaperCoJardinDeParisMemoirNotebook2.jpg)

You can find a section to input your name inside the cover. It says, "From the Desk Of".

<br>

![Rifle Paper Co. Jardin De Paris Memoir Notebook](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016RiflePaperCoJardinDeParisMemoirNotebook3.jpg)

The pages are lined in pink and above every page is a floral stamp. A great notebook to have to write pretty little notes!

<br>

![Rifle Paper Co. Pink Floral Weekly Desk Planner](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016RiflePaperCoPinkFloralWeeklyDeskPlanner.jpg)

**Rifle Paper Co.** Pink Floral Weekly Desk Planner. *Value $12*

Although I personally use a daily planner, this weekly desktop planner that can be utilized as a mouse pad is certainly too pretty and cute to pass up. I will totally use this and since it's not dated, you can use it on any week!

<br>

![LWJ Designs Boss Lady Tumbler](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016LWJDesignsBossLadyTumbler.jpg)

**LWJ Designs** Boss Lady Tumbler, 16 oz. *Value $12*

Boss Lady, yep, that's me! What a cute and fun tumbler, I love it! It's made of acrylic and designed with outdoor grade vinyl. The only drawback for me is that it's hand-wash only, so I need to remind myself not to put this in the dishwasher accidently.

Side note, this actual tumbler came with a crack on the lid but I sent a quick email to their customer support and a new one will be sent to replace it.

<br>

![Kelli Marie Design Raspberry Sangria Hand Poured Soy Wax Candle](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016KelliMarieDesignRaspberrySangriaSoyCandle.jpg)

**Kelli Marie Design** Raspberry Sangria Hand-Poured Soy Wax Candle, 2 oz. *Value $5*

I may have mentioned this before, but I have so many candles in my house right now, I probably can open up a stand and start selling them. But I can't complain since I do love candles and just can't seem to have enough of them. And I certainly don't have one with a raspberry sangria scent yet.

<br>

![Kelli Marie Design Raspberry Sangria Hand Poured Soy Wax Candle](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016KelliMarieDesignRaspberrySangriaSoyCandle2.jpg)

This candle smells amazing! It's sweet and refreshing, it does remind me of sangria and I love that the size is travel friendly.

<br>

![Little White Feather Shop Thin Lace Stretch Headband](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016LittleWhiteFeatherShopThinLaceStretchHeadband.jpg)

**Little White Feather Shop** Thin Lace Stretch Headband. *Value $11*

*Dimensions: 8.5" x 2.5"*

<br>

Subscribers received various colors for this headband and the color I got is a light baby blue color. The value they put for this headband seems a bit high to me ($11), I'm not sure I'd purchase it at that price. Plus I don't really wear headbands that often, and when I do, it's typically when I exercise so I think I'll be gifting this to someone who will actually use it.

<br>

![Pitaya Plus Coupon Card](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016PitayaPlusCouponCard.jpg)

**Pitaya Plus** Coupon Card, 15% Discount.

Pitaya is also known as Dragon Fruit which is a fruit rich in antioxidants, vitamins and high in fiber. [Pitaya Plus](http://www.pitayaplus.com){:target="_blank"} offers smoothie packs and cubes that are made with 100% Pitaya fruit and no added sugar. I can't say I'm a big fan of the Dragon Fruit taste, it's slightly sweet and has the consistency of a kiwi.

<br>

![Pitaya Plus Coupon Card](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016PitayaPlusCouponCard2.jpg)

You need to scratch off the box to get your code so I'm guessing it'll be unique codes.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** This month is their first box since they switched over to bi-monthly delivery and although most of the items were great, it seemed a bit lacking still for me. I felt the same way in my previous box ([you can read that review here](http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Covet-Crate-Girl-Boss-Subscription-Box-May-2016-Review/)
{:target="_blank"}) and was hoping to get a better experience in my next box (which is this one) and I'm left wanting more. If this was a $30 box, I would rave about it. But no, this my dear costs $55 and I expect much more with that price. I am of course comparing to other lifestyle boxes out there with similar price points such as [Popsugar](http://popsugar-must-have.evyy.net/c/164125/137737/2706){:target="_blank"} and [FabFitFun](http://fabfitfun-vip.evyy.net/c/164125/63686/1731){:target="_blank"}. The total value of this box came up to $77, and that's with a headband that I think is a bit overpriced. So in actual, I probably would have paid a little bit more if I just purchased all the items individually without the subscription. I'm still on the fence about continuing the subscription or just cancelling it altogether. Mostly because there have been good curations in the past. Perhaps I'll give them one more chance? Decisions. Decisions.
