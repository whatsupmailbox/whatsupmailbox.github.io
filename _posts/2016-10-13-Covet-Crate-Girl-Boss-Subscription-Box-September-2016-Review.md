**Subscription:** [Covet Crate](http://www.covetcrate.com){:target="_blank"}

**Cost:** $94.95/bi-monthly for the Lady Boss OR $54.95/bi-monthly for the Girl Boss + Free Shipping.

**What's in the box:** Items include things such as: office supplies and accessories, stationery, office decor, style accessories, beauty and skincare items, office snacks, books, discounts (on things such as business/life coaching, classes, etc.), and anything else that may empower, motivate, inspire, and encourage you!

<br>

Covet Crate is a subscription box that is more of a stationery and office product type of box. I enjoyed my last box (you can read my review here) so I had high hopes for this box as well. Let's find out what's in it!

<br>

**This review is for the "Girl Boss" box.**

<br>

First look at unboxing shows the info magazine.

And under the info magazine are the items safely packaged inside.

<br>

<H4>The Info Magazine:</H4>

![Covet Crate Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossSeptember2016Info.jpg)

Every box includes an Info Magazine that spotlights a woman/lady figure who is an inspiration to others through their work or achievement. This month they featured Marie Curie.

<br>

They detail each item that was included in the box as well as a description of not only the items itself, but also the company and/or artist behind it.

<br>

<H4>And here are all the items inside the box:</H4>

![Rifle Paper Co. Garance Doré Leopard Notebook Set](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossSeptember2016RiflePaperCoGaranceDoreNotebookSet02.jpg)

**Rifle Paper Co.** Garance Doré Leopard Notebook Set. *Value $15*

I love love love Rifle Paper Co. so I was happy to find a notebook set from them in this box! The Garance Doré line is super chic too which is gorgeous and totally my style.

They included items from this brand in their last box as well, but I'm not complaining - if their items are included everytime I'd be ecstatic.

<br>

Inside are unlined pages ready for you to jot down your creative ideas or drawings.

<br>

![Steep & Go - Cold Brew Tea Bottle](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossSeptember2016TeaBottle.jpg)

**Steep & Go** Cold Brew Tea Bottle (20 oz.). *Value $12.95*

I personally drink a lot of tea. Cold during summer and hot during winter. Making cold tea requires more preparation and effort but with this bottle, it's super easy and fast too. And not to mention, you can practically make cold tea anywhere, even on the go!

<br>

![Steep & Go - Cold Brew Tea Bottle](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossSeptember2016TeaBottle02.jpg)

The bottle consists of a tea filter and a sports cap. It's BPA-free and dishwasher safe (top rack).

<br>

![Steep & Go - Cold Brew Tea Bottle](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossSeptember2016TeaBottle03.jpg)

As you can see from the instructions that's attached to the bottle, it's really simple and fast to make. Just add tea and water into the bottle, screw the tea filter on, shake the bottle to release the tea flavor, wait 10 minutes and enjoy! Love this nifty bottle, my only complaint is they should have sent this when summer just started so I can use it more!

<br>

![Rifle Paper Co. Pink Floral Weekly Desk Planner](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016RiflePaperCoPinkFloralWeeklyDeskPlanner.jpg)

**Rifle Paper Co.** Pink Floral Weekly Desk Planner. *Value $12*

Although I personally use a daily planner, this weekly desktop planner (that can be utilized as a mouse pad as well) is certainly too pretty and cute to pass up. I will totally use this and since it's not dated, you can use it on any week!

<br>

![LWJ Designs Boss Lady Tumbler](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016LWJDesignsBossLadyTumbler.jpg)

**LWJ Designs** Boss Lady Tumbler, 16 oz. *Value $12*

Boss Lady, yep, that's me! What a cute and fun tumbler, I love it! It's made of acrylic and designed with outdoor grade vinyl. The only drawback for me is that it's hand-wash only, so I need to remind myself not to put this in the dishwasher accidently.

Side note, this actual tumbler came with a crack on the lid but I sent a quick email to their customer support and a new one will be sent to replace it.

<br>

![Kelli Marie Design Raspberry Sangria Hand Poured Soy Wax Candle](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016KelliMarieDesignRaspberrySangriaSoyCandle.jpg)

**Kelli Marie Design** Raspberry Sangria Hand-Poured Soy Wax Candle, 2 oz. *Value $5*

I may have mentioned this before, but I have so many candles in my house right now, I probably can open up a stand and start selling them. But I can't complain since I do love candles and just can't seem to have enough of them. And I certainly don't have one with a raspberry sangria scent yet.

<br>

![Kelli Marie Design Raspberry Sangria Hand Poured Soy Wax Candle](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016KelliMarieDesignRaspberrySangriaSoyCandle2.jpg)

This candle smells amazing! It's sweet and refreshing, it does remind me of sangria and I love that the size is travel friendly.

<br>

![Little White Feather Shop Thin Lace Stretch Headband](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossJuly2016LittleWhiteFeatherShopThinLaceStretchHeadband.jpg)

**Little White Feather Shop** Thin Lace Stretch Headband. *Value $11*

*Dimensions: 8.5" x 2.5"*

<br>

Subscribers received various colors for this headband and the color I got is a light baby blue color. The value they put for this headband seems a bit high to me ($11), I'm not sure I'd purchase it at that price. Plus I don't really wear headbands that often, and when I do, it's typically when I exercise so I think I'll be gifting this to someone who will actually use it.

**Pitaya Plus** Coupon Card, 15% Discount.

Pitaya is also known as Dragon Fruit which is a fruit rich in antioxidants, vitamins and high in fiber. [Pitaya Plus](http://www.pitayaplus.com){:target="_blank"} offers smoothie packs and cubes that are made with 100% Pitaya fruit and no added sugar. I can't say I'm a big fan of the Dragon Fruit taste, it's slightly sweet and has the consistency of a kiwi.

You need to scratch off the box to get your code so I'm guessing it'll be unique codes.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** This month is their first box since they switched over to bi-monthly delivery and although most of the items were great, it seemed a bit lacking still for me. I felt the same way in my previous box ([you can read that review here](http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Covet-Crate-Girl-Boss-Subscription-Box-May-2016-Review/){:target="_blank"}), and was hoping to get a better experience in my next box (which is this one) and I'm left wanting more. If this was a $30 box, I would rave about it. But no, this my dear costs $55 and I expect much more with that price. I am of course comparing to other lifestyle boxes out there with similar price points such as [Popsugar](http://popsugar-must-have.evyy.net/c/164125/137737/2706){:target="_blank"} and [FabFitFun](http://fabfitfun-vip.evyy.net/c/164125/63686/1731){:target="_blank"}. The total value of this box came up to $77, and that's with a headband that I think is a bit overpriced. So in actual, I probably would have paid a little bit more if I just purchased all the items individually without the subscription. I'm still on the fence about continuing the subscription or just cancelling it altogether. Mostly because there have been good curations in the past. Perhaps I'll give them one more chance? Decisions. Decisions.
