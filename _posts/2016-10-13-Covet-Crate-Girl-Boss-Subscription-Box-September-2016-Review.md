**Subscription:** [Covet Crate](http://www.covetcrate.com){:target="_blank"}

**Cost:** $94.95/bi-monthly for the Lady Boss OR $54.95/bi-monthly for the Girl Boss + Free Shipping.

**What's in the box:** Items include things such as: office supplies and accessories, stationery, office decor, style accessories, beauty and skincare items, office snacks, books, discounts (on things such as business/life coaching, classes, etc.), and anything else that may empower, motivate, inspire, and encourage you!

<br>

Covet Crate is a subscription box that is more of a stationery and office product type of box. I enjoyed my last box (you can read my review here) so I had high hopes for this box as well. Let's find out what's in it!

<br>

**This review is for the "Girl Boss" box.**

<br>

And under the info magazine are the items safely packaged inside.

<br>

<H4>The Info Magazine:</H4>

![Covet Crate Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossSeptember2016Info.jpg)

Every box includes an Info Magazine that spotlights a woman/lady figure who is an inspiration to others through their work or achievement. This month they featured Marie Curie.

<br>

They detail each item that was included in the box as well as a description of not only the items itself, but also the company and/or artist behind it.

<br>

<H4>And here are all the items inside the box:</H4>

![Rifle Paper Co. Garance Doré Leopard Notebook Set](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossSeptember2016RiflePaperCoGaranceDoreNotebookSet02.jpg)

**Rifle Paper Co.** Garance Doré Leopard Notebook Set. *Value $15*

I love love love Rifle Paper Co. so I was happy to find a notebook set from them in this box! The Garance Doré line is super chic too which is gorgeous and totally my style.

They included items from this brand in their last box as well, but I'm not complaining - if their items are included everytime I'd be ecstatic.

<br>

Inside are unlined pages ready for you to jot down your creative ideas or drawings.

![Steep & Go - Cold Brew Tea Bottle](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossSeptember2016TeaBottle.jpg)

**Steep & Go** Cold Brew Tea Bottle, 20 oz. *Value $12.95*

I personally drink a lot of tea. Cold during summer and hot during winter. Making cold tea requires more preparation and effort but with this bottle, it's super easy and fast too. And not to mention, you can practically make cold tea anywhere, even on the go!

<br>

![Steep & Go - Cold Brew Tea Bottle](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossSeptember2016TeaBottle02.jpg)

The bottle consists of a tea filter and a sports cap. It's BPA-free and dishwasher safe (top rack).

<br>

![Steep & Go - Cold Brew Tea Bottle](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossSeptember2016TeaBottle03.jpg)

As you can see from the instructions that's attached to the bottle, it's really simple and fast to make. Just add tea and water into the bottle, screw the tea filter on, shake the bottle to release the tea flavor, wait 10 minutes and enjoy! Love this nifty bottle, my only complaint is they should have sent this when summer just started so I can use it more!

![Teemas Tea - Tea Gift Pack](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossSeptember2016TeemaTeasTeaGiftPack.jpg)

**Teemas Tea** Tea Gift Pack. *Value $14*

A tea gift pack to use with my new tea bottle, yay! The teas included inside this gift pack are, Lemongrass Black Tea, Peppermint Green Tea, Osmathus Oolong Tea, and Immortality Tea (caffeine free).

<br>

![Secrets of Six-Figure Women Book by Barbara Stanny](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossSeptember2016SecretsOfSixFigureWomenBarbaraStannyBook.jpg)

**Secrets of Six-Figure Women Book by Barbara Stanny**. *Value $14.99*

This book is geared to help women in reaching financial independence, become smart (or smarter) with money, and earn more than what you're making now. I can't say I'm too excited about this book, or if I had to be honest, I'm never excited to find any book in subscription boxes. It's such a personal preference item plus I love my kindle, so I may just gift this. 

<br>

![Southern Hospitality - Sweet Tea Foot Soak in Georgia Peach](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossSeptember2016SouthernHospitalitySweetTeaFootSoakGeorgiaPeach.jpg)

**Southern Hospitality** Sweet Tea Foot Soak in Georgia Peach. *Value $5*

My feet have taken a beating from the summer flip flop season, so this foot soak has come at a perfect time. The scent is pleasant and all you need to do is dispense the product in 8 cups of warm water and soak feet for 15-20 minutes. Will need to do this asap!

<br>

![The Jane Soap Company - Vanilla Chai Soap Bar](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossSeptember2016TheJaneSoapCompanyVanillaChaiSoapBar.jpg)

**The Jane Soap Company** Vanilla Chai Soap Bar. *Value $3.50*

What an interesting soap bar. It smells exactly like vanilla chai tea, and you can totally tell that this soap bar is made of all natural ingredients.

<br>

![The Jane Soap Company - Vanilla Chai Soap Bar](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossSeptember2016TheJaneSoapCompanyVanillaChaiSoapBar02.jpg)

On one end of the soap bar you'll see traces of the masala chai tea ingredients which is cinnamon sticks, cloves, cardamom, ginger and black tea. It probably will also function well as an exfoliator if you use this side of the bar to soap yourself, will definitely have to test that out and see!

<br>

![Golden Jacks - Salted Peanut and Milk Chocolate Bar](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CovetCrateGirlBossSeptember2016GoldenJacksSaltedPeanutMilkChocolateBar.jpg)

**Golden Jacks** Salted Peanut and Milk Chocolate Bar. *Value $3*

<br>

This snack bar consists of salted peanuts and milk chocolate. They've also included a coupon code for you to use online.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** To be honest, I'm quite disappointed with this box. I wasn't that impressed with the last box either but wanted to give them another chance to see if I'll continue subscribing, and sadly, I don't think I will. I do love the tea bottle and notebook set, but everything else was just meh. After tallying up the total value of all the items, it only came up to $53.45 which is slightly below the $54.95 cost, I mean what the gummy bears. Oh well, I did give them another try, but sadly this subscription will be cancelled.
