[![Brooklyn Wolf Neck Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxJuly2016BrooklynWolfNeckTie.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Brooklyn Wolf** Neck Tie, *Value $29*

You might not think florals look good on ties, but this one just does. The 2 tone colors mute down the busy floral patterns, and the navy blue still makes this quite masculine.

<br>

[![Brooklyn Wolf Neck Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxJuly2016BrooklynWolfNeckTie2.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

This tie is made of 50% linen and 50% cotton. It's thick in material, you can feel the quality that goes in it, and it will surely make you the trendiest guy wherever you rock this.

<br>

[![Weekend Casual Pocket Square](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxJuly2016WeekendCasualPocketSquare.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Weekend Casual** Pocket Square, *Value $20*

This pocket square is made of 100% silk. I'm loving the shades of brown as well as the dotted design. Very classy and it kind of reminds me of Louis Vuitton, it probably could pass as one in my opinion ;) 

<br>

[![Sprezza Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxJuly2016SprezzaSocks.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Sprezza** Socks, *Value $12*

These socks match the pocket square! Pin dots are one of those patterns that will add a touch of style to your outfit without making it clash.

<br>

[![Sprezza Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxJuly2016SprezzaSocks2.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

The bottom of the socks has the Sprezza branding, and the material is soft and elastic. Another great sock to add to the collection!

<br>

**Classics** Roller Pen, *Value $15*

A metal pen is a must have if you want to be seen as classy and sophisticated. And this pen will do just that. It's also packaged in a giftable box so you can gift this to a special someone as well.

<br>

[![Word. Polygon Notebook](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxJuly2016WordPolygonNotebook.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Word.** Polygon Notebook, *Value $4*

I love that they included a notebook to go along with the pen.

<br>

[![Word. Polygon Notebook](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxJuly2016WordPolygonNotebook2.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

This 48-page notebook is lined and the front page has a section to jot down your name, notes as well as a guide on how to mark the circles in the notebook based on the progress of your tasks. I absolutely love that and honestly I never knew this method before so I'm excited to try it!

<br>

[![Hooch App](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxJuly2016HoochApp.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

[![Hooch App](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxJuly2016HoochApp2.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** The curation this month was on point yet again. The floral patterned tie was uber trendy, the bracelet was minimalistic cool, the notebook and the pen made a great combo, just everything in the box was curated to work well into your everyday life and compliment your style.
