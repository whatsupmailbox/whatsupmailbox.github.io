<DD>Full Size .9g/0.03oz, Value $10</DD>
</DL>

<p>This eyeliner goes on smooth, has a matte finish and the color is very pigmented. It also has a built-in smudger that will allow you to easily blend the color, great for a smokey eye look!</p>

<DD>Full Size .5 fl oz / 15 ml, Value $12</DD>
</DL>

<p>SpaRitual nail polishes are vegan and formulated without DBP, toulene, formaldehyde and formaldehyde resin. I have some nail polishes by them already and am a huge fan, so I was super happy when I saw this in the box!</p>

<p>There are different colors that subscribers receive and I got the color Arroyo which is a Sandy Matte Shimmer color, and it really is matte. I love both the color and that it's matte, but if you don't, just put on a regular top coat and it'll make the color glossy.</p>

<p>Here's a picture of the shade on me:</p>

<center><img src='/images/GlossyboxSep2015NailPolish2.jpg'></center>
<p>The color is an opaque blush rose pink that goes on really creamy. I only needed to put one coat on my nails, and I had to be really careful not to grab too much color and swiping it off the bottle so that it doesn't flood my nails for even application.</p>

<DD>Full Size 4g, Value $22</DD>
</DL>

<p>This lash primer creates volume and is developed to nourish and enhance lashes, while creating a base coat that enhances your mascara's effects. It can be worn alone at night as a conditioner too. I've used lash primers from other brands before, so I'm happy I received one in this box and will surely be using this.</p>

<DD>Travel Size 1oz/30g, Value $7.80</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've been a fan of Glamglow and have been using their masks religously for the past few years. So when they came out with a cleanser this year, I just had to try it and instantly fell in love. It's just as good as their masks! Needless to say, I was again ecstatic when I saw this was included in the box.</p>

<DT><a href="https://www.julep.com/rewardsref/index/refer/id/1532991/" target="_blank">Julep</a> - Luxe Up Your Lips in Sheer Coral</DT>
<DD>Full Size 10ml/0.33 fl.oz, Value $4.50</DD>
</DL>

<p>Subscribers received different colors for this lip treatment/gloss and I love mine. It's a pink salmon coral color that goes on sheer and looks great on my tanned olive skin. It's moisturizing, not sticky and has only a bit of shimmer.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I liked the products in this month's box and will be using every single one of them. It's got a good mix of makeup and skincare plus a nail polish so it was an all around well balance box that I can surely use.</p>
