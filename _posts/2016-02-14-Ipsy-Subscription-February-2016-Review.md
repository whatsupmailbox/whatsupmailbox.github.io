<p>Ipsy always ships their bags in bright neon pink padded envelopes, it's hard to miss and I always get happy when I see it in my mailbox!</p>

<p>Ipsy is very similar to <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Birchbox</a> where all subscribers receive different variations in their bag, and is mostly dependent on the answers you give in the Ipsy beauty quiz. They try to give you products that match your needs and concerns so not everyone will get the same items. And you can retake the beauty quiz at anytime if you feel that the products didn't really match you.</p>

<p>This review is for my profile so it's just one of the many variations that they sent out.</p>

<br>

<p>Every month <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d" target="_blank">Ipsy</a> sends their items in makeup bags with an exclusive design. This month's design celebrates Valentine's Day with a heart symbol and is really cute, I like it! The texture also has raised little circles giving it a textured look.</p>

<p>Here's a look at the back of the bag:</p>

</a></center>

<br>

<p>Every bag also includes a note from them depicting the theme of this month's glam bag.<p>

<p>This month's theme is "Pretty in Ipsy Pink", and since it's their signature color, their celebrating it by including this shade with their subscribers.</p>

<DT><b>BelláPierre Cosmetics</b> Mineral Blush in Desert Rose</DT>
<DD>Sifter Jar 6g (Full Size is 9g), Value $30</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: This blush has an inside sticker seal and every subscriber receiving this will get the shade Desert Rose.</i></p>

<p>It's been awhile since I've used a loose powdered blush, I may just be too lazy to swirl, tap and buff. But I'm open to trying it out again. Plus this came in quite a large sized jar, hurray, this will surely last me for quite some time.</p>

<p>This blush looks great and goes on quite naturally on my olive skin tone. It also talc-free, paraben-free, and suitable for all skin types and conditions which is music to my ears. So glad I got this!</p>

<DT><b>IT Cosmetics</b> Bye Bye Under Eye® Anti-Aging Concealer in Tan</DT>
<DD>Travel Size 0.11 fl.oz. (Full Size .28 fl.oz.), Value $30</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: ipsters who receive this product will receive the shade Light, Medium, or Tan.</i></p>

<p>I appreciate the fact that they actually matched the shade of this concealer to my actual skin color. I looked into my beauty profile and I did indicate Tan as my skin tone, so if you got this too, it should be matched to the skin tone you stated in your beauty profile.</p>

<p>This concealer went on smoothly and did not settle on my lines or looked patchy. It I tried to wash my hands with just soap and water, and this swatch would not budge no matter how much I scrubbed. I ended up having to use eye makeup remover to finally get it off. Needless to say, this is a keeper and I just might have to buy more colors!</p>

<DT><b>OFRA Cosmetics</b> Universal Eyebrow Pencil</DT>
<DD>Full Size 0.04 oz., Value $13</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've received this eyebrow pencil from Ofra Cosmetics before in my Little Lace Box subscription. I tried it then and did not like it at all. It wasn't very long lasting and in order to get a precise line or filling for my eyebrows, I had to constantly sharpen it because the pencil itself is quite thick. This was both annoying and wasteful in my opinion. Because of that, this eyebrow pencil will be gifted and another miss for me.</p>

<DD>Travel Size 10 cleansing cloths, Value $5</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm super happy I received these facial cleansing clothes! I'm a fan of their eye patches and have always wanted to try these since it has gotten great reviews.</p>

<p>"When you're too tired to deal with the whole cleanser and wash cloth routine, these on-the-go foaming cloths are the ultimate skin savior. Infused with Icelandic glacial waters and beneficial natural extracts, they sweep away makeup, dirt, oil and other impurities while refreshing and soothing stressed skin. Best of all, there's no water required. It has a clean scent, never tacky. Great for travel or every day!"</p>

<DT><b>Jelly Pong Pong</b> Fairy Lashes CURL Mascara</DT>
<DD>Full Size 8 ml, Value $21.95</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: This mascara came sealed.</i></p>

<p>"Fairy Lashes CURL is a sculpting, curling mascara that continually curls lashes throughout the day with a unique synthesis of Moringa Seed resin that dries down and holds the curl of lashes for long-lasting results. The unique brush instantly creates dramatic volume and intense definition."</p>

<p>Although this mascara sounds great and may be perfect for me, unfortunately the ingredients have paraben in them and that's a total no-no for me, so sadly this will have to be passed along.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Although I'm happy that I received 4 full-sized products out of the 5 that's in the bag, unfortunately most of the products were a miss and will not be used. I did like the eyeliner and the cleansing cloths, and those 2 items alone are worth double the subscription cost, so I'm still happy with it. I have now updated my beauty profile to see if I could get a better match in products next month, and I hope I do.</p>
