<br>

The October 2016 box is titled <big>The Trinity</big>, named after the Trinity Street near Wall Street and is one of the more formal and iconic areas of NYC. So I'm guessing the items this month will have a formal theme which I love, yay!

<br>

[![Countess Mara Neck Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxOctober2016CountessMaraNeckTie.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Countess Mara** Necktie, *Value $65*

This is a 100% silk tie and it has a unique Inteli-Stretch Technology built into the neck for maximum comfort. The houndstooth pattern with black and silver color is also uber modern, perfect for that stylish dapper look. And in case you want to expand your Countess Mara collection, they are available for purchase at Macy's.

[![Sprezza NYC Cufflinks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxOctober2016SprezzaNYCCuffLinks.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Sprezza NYC** Cufflinks, *Value $20*

Cufflinks are an accessory that I think often gets forgotten amongst the majority of men, but it really is a statement piece to wear and certainly adds great value to your whole look, especially when you're in the executive level of work or even if you want to have an uber dapper look.

<br>

[![Sprezza NYC Cufflinks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxOctober2016SprezzaNYCCuffLinks02.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

These cufflinks will surely be used and I love the silver and black look, it goes with just about anything and perfect for my husband's style.

<br>

[![Paul Evans Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxOctober2016PaulEvansSocks.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Paul Evans** Socks, *Value $20*

Black socks are my husband's favorite, he wears them with just about anything because they're just so versatile.

<br>

[![Paul Evans Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxOctober2016PaulEvansSocks02.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

The socks are thick and soft which will be perfect for fall and winter. A great item to include in this month's box!

<br>

[![Classic Business Card Holder](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxOctober2016ClassicBusinessCardHolder.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Classic** Business Card Holder, *Value $15*

A business card holder is a must carry at all times for my husband because he travels a lot for business and you just never know when you meet people for networking no matter where you are.

<br>

[![Classic Business Card Holder](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxOctober2016ClassicBusinessCardHolder02.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

This card holder is all silver and all stylishly sleek. It fits business cards perfectly and snaps closed without any issue. The only problem I encountered is because it's silver allover, it does transfer fingerprints and smudges easily when handling it, but one simple swipe with a cloth and it's all gone.

<br>

[![The Fashion Anchor](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxOctober2016TheFashionAnchor.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**The Fashion Anchor** 6-pack, *Value $3*

These are sticky circle dots that you can attach to your collar so that they stay put and don't curl or fly away.

<br>

Here's how they actually look:

<br>

Such a simple tool yet so useful and easy to use. My husband will surely be using this a lot!

<br>

[![Frey For Men - Oak Musk Detergent](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxOctober2016FreyForMenOakMuskDetergent.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Frey For Men** Oak Musk Detergent, *Value $4*

This was one item I wasn't expecting to receive in a men's subscription box! I never knew that they had detergent specifically targeted for men and I'm sure my husband will appreciate this. Finally his clothes and my clothes will have appropriate scents, we don't wear the same perfumes so our laundry shouldn't either. Excited to try this!

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** I loved this month's theme! It's formal, modern and stylish, it really represents that Wall Street gentleman look. The silk tie was a big favorite, but I also loved finding out about new products such as the Fashion Anchors and the bottle of men's detergent. I think this is my favorite Sprezza Box as of yet and I'm super happy with every single item this month!
