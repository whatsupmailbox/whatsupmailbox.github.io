<br>

The October 2016 box is titled <big>The Trinity</big>, named after the Trinity Street near Wall Street and is one of the more formal and iconic areas of NYC. So I'm guessing the items this month will have a formal theme which I love, yay!

[![MRKT Sunglasses Case](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxSeptember2016MRKTSunglassesCase.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**MRKT** Sunglasses Case, *Value $15*

This is a case to protect your sunglasses from scratches and dirt. Closure is done by a wrap around tie as shown in the picture.

<br>

Once you open it up, you see that it has two slots to insert your sunglasses.

At first I was a bit worried because the case is flat and wondered how on earth will sunglasses fit in this, but it works and it really does protect it. My husband will definitely be using this when he's traveling and doesn't want to use the typical sunglasses case that are bulky and big.

<br>

[![Sprezza NYC Necktie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxSeptember2016SprezzaNeckTie.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Sprezza NYC** Neck Tie, *Value $30*

This red and blue tie has the classic diagonal stripes pattern that my husband will have no problem wearing. It's made of 100% Silk and is Dry Clean only of course. It feels high quality as all Sprezza brand products are.

<br>

[![Gent's Lounge Tie Clip](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxSeptember2016GentsLoungeTieClip.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Gent's Lounge** Tie Clip, *Value $25*

A silver tie clip with the Fleur-de-lis symbol that represents perfection, light, and life.

<br>

Here's a closer look at it:

The detail is very intricate and well done. The spring for the clip is also smooth and grips the tie well without damaging the material. A very well made tie clip that will surely last!

<br>

[![Sprezza Pocket Square](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxSeptember2016SprezzaPocketSquare.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Sprezza** Pocket Square, *Value $18*

I'm loving the pattern on this pocket square! It's fun and modern but still classy at the same time. The blue will perfectly tie in with the tie and pocket square. Made of 100% cotton - Dry Clean only.

<br>

[![Weekend Casual Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxSeptember2016WeekendCasualSocks.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Weekend Casual** Socks, *Value $10*

Polka dot socks! The colors are blue and red of course and my husband loves this. It fits into his business work life and will go great when he needs to dress up to meet clients. It also feels soft and has a good grip when worn so it doesn't slide down.

<br>

[![Niche For Men Multi Wash](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxSeptember2016NicheForMenMultiWash.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Niche For Men** Multi Wash, *Value $3.99*

This is an all-in-one shampoo, body wash and shave cream. Just the type of product my husband loves - something easy and all-in-one. This way he just needs to bring this one item when traveling versus separate products for each purpose. It's also all-natural with aloe vera and essential oils, and it smeels very fresh and clean too. A great multi-wash that I'm sure any man would appreciate!

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** This month had items that were very functional. Everything will surely be used and although it felt a bit lacking in the wow factor as I typically am with this box (personal preference), it still had its high value. The total value of everything in this box came up to $101.99 which is more than triple the cost! The silk tie was the definite winner in this box and made the cost totally worth it. Here's to hoping next month will bring more exciting items!
