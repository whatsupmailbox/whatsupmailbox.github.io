<br>

The October 2016 box is titled <big>The Trinity</big>, named after the Trinity Street near Wall Street and is one of the more formal and iconic areas of NYC. So I'm guessing the items this month will have a formal theme which I love, yay!

**Countess Mara** Necktie, *Value $65*

This is a 100% silk tie and it has a unique Inteli-Stretch Technology built into the neck for maximum comfort. The houndstooth pattern wih black and silver color is also uber modern, perfect for that cool dapper look. And in case you want to expand your Countess Mara collection, they are available for purchase at Macy's.

**Sprezza NYC** Cufflinks, *Value $20*

Cufflinks are an accessory that I think often gets forgotten amongst the majority of men, but it really is a statement piece to wear and certainly adds great value to your whole look, especially when you're in the executive level of work or even if you want to have an uber dapper look. So this was a great item to include for this month's box!

<br>

[![Sprezza NYC Cufflinks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxOctober2016SprezzaNYCCuffLinks02.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

These cufflinks will surely be used and I love the silver and black look, it goes with just about anything and perfect for my husband's style.

**Paul Evans** Socks, *Value $20*

Black socks are my husband's favorite, he wears them with just about anything because they're just so versatile.

**Classic** Business Card Holder, *Value $15*

A business card holder is a must for my husband because he travels a lot for business and you just never know when you meet people for networking no matter where you are.

<br>

[![Classic Business Card Holder](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxOctober2016ClassicBusinessCardHolder02.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

This card holder is all silver and all stylishly sleek. It fits business cards perfectly and snaps closed without any issue. The only problem I encountered is because it's silver allover, it does easily transfer fingerprints and smudges easily when handling it, but one simple swipe with a cloth and it's all gone.

<br>

[![The Fashion Anchor](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxOctober2016TheFashionAnchor.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**The Fashion Anchor** 6-pack, *Value $3*

These are sticky circle dots that you can attach to your collar so that they stay put and don't curl or fly away.

<br>

Here's how they actually look:

Such a simple tool yet so useful and easy to use. My husband will surely be using this a lot!

[![Niche For Men Multi Wash](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxOctober2016FreyForMenOakMuskDetergent.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Niche For Men** Multi Wash, *Value $3.99*

This is an all-in-one shampoo, body wash and shave cream. Just the type of product my husband loves - something easy and all-in-one. This way he just needs to bring this one item when traveling versus separate products for each purpose. It's also all-natural with aloe vera and essential oils, and it smeels very fresh and clean too. A great multi-wash that I'm sure any man would appreciate!

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** This month had items that were very functional. Everything will surely be used and although it felt a bit lacking in the wow factor as I typically am with this box (personal preference), it still had its high value. The total value of everything in this box came up to $101.99 which is more than triple the cost! The silk tie was the definite winner in this box and made the cost totally worth it. Here's to hoping next month will bring more exciting items!
