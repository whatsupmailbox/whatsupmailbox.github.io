[Trendy Butler](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"} is a subscription that delivers brand name and trendy menswear based on a style profile that you complete upon subscribing. Not only do they take your profile into consideration when selecting items for you, they also take into account your location to send you appropriate weather clothes, how awesome is that! And since my husband hates shopping, this subscription has been a life saver for him!

<br>

[![First look at unpacking](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/TrendyButlerOctober2016OpenPackage.jpg)](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"}

Trendy Butler sends their items in a thick brown paper envelope and when you open that, you see the items packaged neatly inside.

<br>

<H4>Based on my husband's profile, here is what they sent:</H4>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

[![Trendy Butler - Thomas Payne Cedric Blue Classic Fit Long Sleeve Shirt](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/TrendyButlerOctober2016ThomasPayneCedricShirt.jpg)](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"}

**[Thomas Payne - Cedric Blue Classic Fit Long Sleeve Shirt](https://thomas-payne.myshopify.com/collections/long-sleeve-shirts/products/cedric-blue-classic-fit-long-sleeve-shirt){:target="_blank}**, *Value $115*

<br>

My last package featured this brand and my husband loved the shirt so I'm happy to find it again in this month's package.

<br>

Here's how it looks on:

<br>

The pattern and blue color works well for my husband, and the longer sleeve will fit right in as we head towards colder weather.

**[Standard Issue NYC - Classic Khaki Pants](http://www.standardissuenyc.com/collections/shop-men/products/classic-pants-1){:target="_blank"}**, *Value $95*

<br>

Khaki pants are a good way to be casual yet still dapper. The size and fit is great and from what I see on their website, the model wore these pants rolled up so hopefully I can convince my husband to try that look one day, wish me luck!

<br>

Here's how it looks on:

It looks good when paired with the shirt, but I think my husband will probably be wearing this most with his cool graphic shirts or concert tees.

<br>

[![Trendy Butler - Standard Issue NYC Gray Sweater](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/TrendyButlerOctober2016StandardNYCGraySweater.jpg)](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"}

**Standard Issue NYC** Gray Sweater. *Value $85 (estimate)*

This sweater is soft and warm, and the solid grey color with two different texture in the mix makes this a classic style with a slight modern twist.

<br>

Here's how it looks on:

<br>

It has two side pockets and a chest pocket on the front for storage, and it's made of 65% cotton and 35% polyester.

The back view shows the hoodie and you also see the mix of two textures in this sweater's design. My husband totally loves this sweater, it's simple design and quality material is right up his alley!

<br>
