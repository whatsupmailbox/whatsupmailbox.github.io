<p><b>Subscription:</b><a href="http://www.treatsie.com"> Treatsie Box</a></p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $15 / month + $4.95 shipping</p>
<p><b>Deal:</b> Purchase on <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/invite/whatsupmailbox">Rue La La</a> to get your first box at 40% off!</p>
<p><b>What's in the box:</b> An assortment of the best gourmet sweets from ever-changing vendors all over the country. 
3 different vendors every month and up to $25 worth of gourmet sweerts per box.</p>

<p>This is a good deal to try out Conscious Box and see if it's right for you. I'd suggest trying the 1-month deal as it's not that much savings compared to the 3-month deal.</p>

<p>Here are the prices on <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/invite/whatsupmailbox">Rue La La</a>:
<ul>
<li>1 month $12 (reg. $19.95)</li>
<li>3 months $34 (reg. $56.85)</li>
<li>6 months $64 (reg. 107.70)</li>
</ul>

<p>*Note: You will be enrolled in their monthly Plus box subscription afterwards, so make sure to cancel prior if you don't plan on keeping the subscription. You can cancel directly through your online account.</p>
