<p>Because of my husband's <strike>addiction</strike> love for coffee, he chose the "Roast" box for June. See what other boxes were released for June 2015 in <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/Bespoke-Post-June-2015-Selections/" target="_blank">my previous post</a>.</p>

<p>The items inside were packaged very well and secure as you can see from the pictures above. They were wrapped in bubble wrap, put inside another box or tighter wrap to ensure minimal movement, and finished with a black tissue paper.</p>

<DT>Bespoke Post - Manual Burr Grinder</DT>
<DD>Value $30</DD>
</DL>

<p>This manual grinder is so cool and easy to use. And yes, there is truth that freshly ground coffee tastes better than pre-ground and since we actually don't have a coffee grinder, this is a great addition to our house! Plus the size is conveninet and travel friendly, and the handle on top can be detached so you can pack it easier too.</p>
<p>I tried grinding some coffee beans this morning and although it was easy to use, it did take quite a bit of energy to grind. Using the handle and rotating it clockwise was easy, but holding the actual grinder with my other hand so it doesn't move or topple over as you grind got to be a bit harder than I thought. But the end result was perfectly ground coffee. See picture below.</p>

<DT><a href="http://www.waterbobble.com/silver-stainless-steel-coffee-press#.VYh03GC210s" target="_blank">Bobble - Presse Stainless Steel Coffee Press in Silver</a></DT>
<DD>Retail Value $29.95</DD>
</DL>

<p>What a cool looking coffee press! It'll brew your coffee and you can take it on the go as well, how awesome is that.</p>
<p>Here's just some of the cool features this press has:
<ul>
<li> Makes up to 13 oz. of coffee!</li>
<li> 6" tall, 3.375" diameter (approximate)</li>
<li> Unique micro-filter separates grounds from finished coffee and traps them at the bottom to stop brewing immediately when pressed.</li>
<li> 3 layers of insulation to keep your coffee hot and yet the outside remains cool, plus a silicone heat-resistant lid!</li>
<li> It only takes 3 minutes to brew your cofee. Once pressed, just add the lid and your coffee is ready to roll.</li>
<li> Easy to clean. No flimsy screen that gets clogged with coffee grounds, no worries about breaking the glass part of your press. Just use soap & warm water, and it's ready to brew the next cup.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<DT><a href="https://squareup.com/market/dapper-and-wise-roasters" target="_blank">Dapper & Wise Roasters Coffee Bean in Brazil - Fazenda Silvestre</a></DT>
<DD>12 oz., Value $14</DD>
</DL>

<p>This coffee is sweet & nutty with a light acidity and cacao chocolate finish. It has notes of milk chocolate, honey, and citrus. The coffee beans are roasted on a Diedrich 12 kilo drum roaster in a small-batch artisan fashion and my package states that it was roasted in June 2015 so its as fresh as you can get!</p>
<p>Dapper & Wise is based in Portland, Oregon and they have a tasting room as well as a cafe for you to experience their products in person.</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> When I looked at the spoilers last month, I was really excited about the sunglasses and now that I have it on hand, it'll be my go-to for sunglasses this summer. The only item I disliked was the book, and maybe I'm not alone here, but I'm not sure how a book inclusion fits with the Popsugar Must Have theme this month. The total value came up to $129.77 (that's with the gift card and using Amazon's price for the book) and that's not a bad value for a $39.95 subscription. Even without the book I would have felt like I got double my money's worth so I'm content. Next month's theme is "Beach Days, Fourth of July, Easy Travel, and Summer Heat", <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/Popsugar-Must-Have-July-2015-Spoiler-Theme/" targe="_blank"> see my post about it here </a>, and I can't wait to see some spoilers!</p>
