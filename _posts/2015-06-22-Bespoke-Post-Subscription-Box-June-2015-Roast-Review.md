<p>The items inside were packaged very well and secure as you can see from the pictures above. They were wrapped in bubble wrap, put inside another box or tighter wrap to ensure minimal movement, and finished with a black tissue paper.</p>

<p>OMG, these sunglasses are so cool and fit me perfectly! I love that its light, fits my Asian nose (thank goodness!), and is simple yet uber cool. #soinlove</p>

<p>Here's a view of the sunglasses from the side:</p>

<p>You see how simple the design is, no overly bling or big "in-your-face" logo, just two silver dots. Nice.</p>

<p>I'm more than happy that Popsugar decided to include sunglasses this month, just in time for the sunny summer days. I know that probably not everyone is happy getting this since sunglasses require specific preference and depends on shape of face, but they did pick a style that's more universal when compared to Q/A's other styles, which I love by the way and am already eyeing a few that needs to be in my posession asap!</p>

<p>This is what was giving that amazing scent when I opened the box, smells so heavenly. They have the exact scent in a lotion too, I just might have to get that.</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> When I looked at the spoilers last month, I was really excited about the sunglasses and now that I have it on hand, it'll be my go-to for sunglasses this summer. The only item I disliked was the book, and maybe I'm not alone here, but I'm not sure how a book inclusion fits with the Popsugar Must Have theme this month. The total value came up to $129.77 (that's with the gift card and using Amazon's price for the book) and that's not a bad value for a $39.95 subscription. Even without the book I would have felt like I got double my money's worth so I'm content. Next month's theme is "Beach Days, Fourth of July, Easy Travel, and Summer Heat", <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/Popsugar-Must-Have-July-2015-Spoiler-Theme/" targe="_blank"> see my post about it here </a>, and I can't wait to see some spoilers!</p>
