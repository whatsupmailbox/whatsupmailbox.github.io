<p><b>Box:</b> <a href="http://www.nourishbeautybox.com/ac/WHATSUPMAILBOX" target="_blank">Popsugar Must Have</a> Nourish Beauty Box</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $34.95 + Free Shipping</p>
<p><b>Shipping:</b> Ships Worldwide absolutely FREE!</p>
<p><b>What's in the box:</b> This box (bag) comes all the way from England and is packed with organic, cruelty-free, ingredient-conscious beauty products. You'll receive 3 full-sized products + 1 eco friendly exclusive Nourish Beauty Box designed bag. $70+ retail value in every shipment!</p>
<br>

<p>I admit, I'm a beauty addict and when I was young, I didn't care what ingredients were in my makeup and skincare, but as I'm getting older (and hopefully wiser) I care more about what I put on my skin. Now all my products are paraben-free, phthalates-free, etc, etc.</p>

<p>Nourish Beauty Box caters to those who are beauty enthusiasts who want healthier and purer products. Plus they send out full-sized products only and a tote bag too!</p>

<p>As I mentioned, this subscription comes all the way from UK so it may take a bit longer to arrive to subscribers in the U.S. depending on customs. They mention to allow up to 10 business days for it to arrive, but it should get to you around the 25th of each month.</p>

<p>The items were individually packaged in bubble wrap to ensure it arrives to you in one piece. It also helps to contain any leakage if it that was to ever occur. All my items came in one piece and had absolutely no leakage.</p>

<br>

<p>This month's bag has a Christmas and winter themed design. The quality of the bag itself seems strong and sturdy, and the size is quite substantial too, about the same size as a standard reusable tote (approx. 16" x 14"). I can't wait to use this on my next farmer's market run!</p>

<DT><b>Seraphine Botanicals</b> Passionfruit + Mango Body Butter</DT>
<DD>Full Size 30ml, Value $17.95</DD>
</DL>

<p>This lotion is more like a travel size and comes sealed with plastic wrap. The lotion's consistency is not thick at all and very quick drying. The scent is sweet and fruity, almost like a sweet passionfruit mango smoothie. I almost want to lick my hand everytime I smell it!</p>

<p>I found this lotion to be moisturizing and not sticky at all. This product is 100% vegan, cruelty-free, natural & hand-blended. Even the design printed on the lotion's tube itself is made with soy ink!</p>

<DT><b>Prim Botanicals</b> The Face Oil</DT>
<DD>Full Size 30ml, Value $60</DD>
</DL>

<p>I rarely use face oil, only because I haven't had great results with it so I'm very hopefuly with this one. This face oil is rich in omega fatty acids to help reduce inflammation, signs of aging, and helps precent both blemishes and congestion while simultaneously providing hydration. It says it's great for all skin types, even the most sensitive ones so I think it's safe for me to try (my skin is super sensitive!).</p>

<p>Prim Botanicals makes their products in small batches and when I checked out their website, all their products are sold out. Hopefully a new batch is coming soon since I have my eye on their lip balms that are packaged in beautiful slide-open tins, as well as their candle. I love this brand and hope I can try out more of their products as soon as they have them available for sale again.</p>

<DT><b>Peony Cosmetics</b> Lemon Drop Tinted Moisturizer SPF 20</DT>
<DD>Full Size 30ml, Value $32</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Quick note: This bottle did not come sealed or packaged.</i</p>

<p>Tinted moisturizers are a must for my casual and stay-at-home days. I may have heard about this brand and I'm not sure when or where, but I'm happy to try this moisturizer out. I checked out their website and couldn't find this product at all available there, and with a quick search online, I couldn't even find it available anywhere else. Hopefully it's not because it has been discontinued.</p>

<p>This moisturizer has a cream-gel like texture that initially shows a light peachy color upon dispense, but after massaging it on to my face, the color transforms to blend with your skintone. It does have a scent due to the fragrance in its ingredients, and it smells somewhat sweet almost like shea butter. The formula in this moisturizer also helps to even out your skintone, and diminish the appearance of pores & fine lines, but it also hydrates, primes, and protects your skin at the same time. I've only tried this once and so far so good. I"m just not that into the scent it has, but that's just my personal preference.</p>
