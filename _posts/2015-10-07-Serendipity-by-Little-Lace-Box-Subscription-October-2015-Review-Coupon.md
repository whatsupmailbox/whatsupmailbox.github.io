<center><H4>Serendipity is a new subscription by Little Lace Box and this review is for their first launch package!</H4></center>

<p><b>Subscription:</b> <a href="http://littlelacebox.com?rfsn=93842.4b16b">Serendipity by Little Lace Box</a></p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $9.99 bi-monthly (on the off months of the Little Lace Box) with Free Shipping</p>
<p><b>Products:</b> You'll receive 5-7 sample size (sometimes full-size) items that Little Lace Box deemed great finds and wanted to share. Since it's still new, I can't really say what you probably would expect from this subscription, so I'll leave it at that for now.</p>
<p><b>Coupon:</b> Serendipity is currently FREE for current <a href="http://littlelacebox.com?rfsn=93842.4b16b">Litte Lace Box</a> subscribers, but if you haven't subscribed to <a href="http://littlelacebox.com?rfsn=93842.4b16b">Litte Lace Box</a>, use coupon code <a href="http://littlelacebox.com?rfsn=93842.4b16b">REDLACE</a> for $10 off your subscription!</p>

<p>I was surprised to see a white padded envelope from Little Lace Box, but after opening it up, I finally found their signature red packagin!</p>

<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

<DL>
<DT>OFRA Cosmetics - Eyeliner in Brown</DT>
<DD>Full Size .04 oz., Value $12.95</DD>
</DL>

<p>This is a water resistant eyeliner. I'm not too fond of eyeliners that have to be sharpened and I end up trying it once then never using it again, so I'll have to pass this along.</p>

<DL>
<DT>Beekman 1802 - Honeyed Grapefruit Facial Cleansing Wipes</DT>
<DD>Full Size, Value $7</DD>
</DL>
<p>Beekman 1802</p>

<br>

<DL>
<DT>Beekman 1802 - Wondermint Lip Balm Stick</DT>
<DD>Full Size, Value $8</DD>
</DL>
<p>I was wondering what was in this tube, and I'm happy to report that it's a lip balm! I can never have enough lip balms, I have them eh-ve-ry-where!</p>

<p>This has a minty taste and feel when applying it on, and it moisturized my lips well. Off it goes into my bag!</p>
<br>

<DL>
<DT><a href='http://brode.co'>Brode - Electrolyte Vitamin</a></DT>
<DD>1 pouch with 2 tablets inside, Retail Value $4</DD>
</DL>
<p>What a great find! This vitamin promises to hydrate you with electrolytes so you can say adios to dehydration.</p>
<p>Our bodies can get dehydrated from being too active (like in sports), traveling (on a plane) or drinking (perhaps more than you should). So this vitamin is perfect for that and "studies show that 4 out of 5 people who take Brode while drinking say that they feel much better the next day, with less hangover". That's music to my ears!</p>

<p><b>My Thoughts:</b> <a href="http://littlelacebox.com?rfsn=93842.4b16b">Little Lace Box</a> continues to wow me with every shipment and now another subscription by them that's only $9.99/month, I mean come on, that's a no brainer. Plus right now this subscription is included for free (yes FREE) to current subscribers while they work out their systems. The total value of this package came out to $46.85! Even if I paid for this subscription, I'd be ecstatic. What a great package and once they sort out the kinks on this subscription, I'll be subscribing in a heartbeat!</p>
