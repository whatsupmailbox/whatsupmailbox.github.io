<p>Packages came in their typical white plastic bag, exactly like the women's Fabletics.

<H4>And here are the items:</H4>

<DL>
<DT>Hagen Tee in Heather/Black</DT>
<DD>Retail Value $39.95, VIP Member Price $29.95</DD>
<p>This shirt is perfect in every way! It has side mesh panels which is great for those sweaty workouts, then it has reflective details so you can be seen in the dark. The texture is soft and it stretches for comfort. My husband absolutely loved it!</p>

<DT>Forster Short in Black/Shale</DT>
<DD>Retail Value $64.95, VIP Member Price $49.95</DD>
<p>And another great item! These pants also have side mesh panels, a built in liner, and zippered pockets... perfect. My husband loved them so much that I'll be buying the blue color version next month.</p>

<p><b>VERDICT:</b> The Batona outfit was such a great hit for my husband that although he was hesitant to have a subscription for activewear, he has now been converted and will continue to subscribe. The total value of the outfit came up to $104.90 in retail value, and with VIP membership pricing it goes down to $79.90. But since I have their FL2 subscription, I only paid $59.95 which is a great deal for these 2 amazing items. Hopefully they add more items such as these to the men's collection.</p>
