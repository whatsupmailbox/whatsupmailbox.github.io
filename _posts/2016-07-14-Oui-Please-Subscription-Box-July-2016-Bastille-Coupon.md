In honor of Bastille day, The French National Day, [Oui Please](http://ouipleasebox.com){:target="_blank"} is having an amazing coupon going on now till Sunday, July 17th. Get 30% off any length of subscription with code <b>BASTILLE</b>!!! This is by far the best coupon they've ever came out with so if you've been secretly wishing to try this luxe French subscription out, now is definitely the best time to do so!

I'm actually almost up for my annual renewal so I used this coupon for another year of amazing French goodies. If you purchase the annual plan (which does not auto-renew), each box will end up costing $75.83 for a box that costs $150 regularly. That my dear, is pretty much 50% off! Ah-mazing.

If you sign up now, your first box will be Vol. 2.3: Summer Escapade and spoilers have been coming out. Checkout my previous [post of these spoilers here](http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/coupons/Oui-Please-Vol-2-3-Subscription-Box-Spoilers-News-Coupon/){:target="_blank"} or you can [view the full spoilers on their website](http://ouipleasebox.com/the-big-our-reveal-is-here-vol-2-3-summer-escapade/){:target="_blank"}.
