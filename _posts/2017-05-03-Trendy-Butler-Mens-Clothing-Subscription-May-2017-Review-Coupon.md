**ourCaste** Kevin Long Sleeve Plaid Button Up Shirt, *Value $62*

The big red checkered pattern is bright and bold, perfect for spring and summer and great when paired with jeans or khakis. The material includes a moisture wicking fabric coating that's designed to wick away moisture from the body and speed up the evaporation process. How awesome is that!

Plus this brand is from California AND they focus on designing products that are both stylish and functional, gotta support my local businesses!

<br>

Here's how it looks on:

I love how the shirt perfectly fits my husband's build, and how striking the color looks on with jeans. And with the moisture wicking fabric coating in place, you can be confident in wearing this even if the sun decides to shine brighter on you.

**Cohesive & Co.** Malo Zip Front Hoodie in Army Black, *Value $150*

My husband LOVES this brand and has been getting it quite frequently in his packages - no complaints and always thankful! He wears a lot of hoodies cause it does get chilly here at night in Cali so this was happily received. Plus he'll be traveling to Chicago this weekend and it's still a bit cold there, so he'll be bringing this along for sure!

The color is subtle yet contrast with its two-tone colors, and the gold zipper adds a little edge to it. I kind of wish they made this exact style for women cause I'm loving it!

The two kangaroo pockets has a black lining on the opening, as well as a black band on the bottom of the sweater.

The bottom of the sides has zippers on them. It can be unzipped for extra room and comfort, or for ventilation.

The backside has elbow patches which my husband loves. It adds texture and contrast, and makes this an all-around stylish hoodie!

This sweater is totally my husband's type of style and he was ecstatic when he saw this in the package. He loved how luxe and soft the material feels, plus the simple yet trendy look was spot on with his style profile.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This month's package brought items that were both amazing! The shirt and sweater came at a perfect time as my husband will be traveling for business and in need of business casual shirts, and a sweater for the actual travel. If my husband saw these items in a store, he would buy it in a heartbeat, that's how spot on their styling was this month! If you're a current subscriber, be sure to communicate with them what your needs are or if you have a certain request, they're very good at listening and trying their best to style your package to your liking, so don't be shy! My husband is super duper trooper happy with this month's styling, but then again they've never disappoint. Looking forward to next month's package, stay tuned for that review!
