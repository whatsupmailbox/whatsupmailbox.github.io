<h4>Items in detail:</h4>

**ourCaste** Kevin Long Sleeve Plaid Button Up Shirt, *Value $62*

I couldn't really find this style on their website or online, so I'm estimating the value based on their other button down shirts.

I've been getting this brand quite frequently in my packages, and my husband actually loves them so no complaints here!

<br>

Here's how it looks on:

The bold and big red checkered pattern fits so we certainly a classic to have, and it pairs really well with either blue or black jeans. This shirt had a "Sharp Fit", which is another name for slim fit, and since that's what my husband's profile stated, naturally it was a perfect fit.

**Cohesive & Co.** Malo Zip Front Hoodie in Army Black, *Value $150*

My husband LOVES this brand and has been getting it quite frequently in his packages - no complaints and always thankful! He wears a lot of hoodies cause it does get chilly here at night in Cali so this was happily received. Plus he'll be travelling to Chicago this weekend and it's stil a bit cold there, so he'll be bringing this along for sure!

The color is subtle yet contrast with its two-tone green and khaki colors, and the gold zipper adds a little edge to it. I kind of wish they made this exact style for women cause I'm loving it!

The two pockets has a black lining on the opening for style, as well as a black band on the bottom of the sweater.

The bottom of the sides has zippers on them. It can be unzipped for extra room and comfort, or for ventilation.

The backside has elbow patches which my husband loves. It adds texture and contrast, and makes this an all-around stylish hoodie!

This sweater is totally my husband's type of style and he was ecstatic when he saw this in the package. He loved how luxe and soft the material feels, plus the simple yet trendy look was spot on with his style profile.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This month's package brought items that were both amazing! The shirt and sweater came at a perfect time as my husband will be travelling for business and in need of business casual shirts, and a sweater for the actual travel. If my husband saw these items in a store, he would buy it for sure, that's how spot on their styling was this month!
