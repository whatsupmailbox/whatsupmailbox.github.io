[![Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxSeptember2016Info.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

<br>

[![Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxSeptember2016Info02.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

I find their info magazines to be so very useful. It details each item in the box as well as the brand/creator behind it.

<br>

[![Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxSeptember2016Info03.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

[![Evoke Patriot Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxSeptember2016EvokePatriotSocks.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Evoke** Patriot Socks, *Value $24*

<br>

These socks have red and blue stripes with white lines in between them. I can see how they're called Patriot socks! It's also made of 80% cashmere blend, and you can feel how soft it is!

The company behind these socks is owned by former professional basketball player Andreas Schreiber, and they have a mission to give back to the world through various social causes.

<br>

[![Evoke Patriot Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxSeptember2016EvokePatriotSocks02.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

I love supporting companies that have a social mission as well. And from what they say, it seems that they're helping a lot of people and causes, kudos to them!

[![Wolf Clothing Co. - Gold Feather Lapel Pin](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxSeptember2016WolfClothingCoGoldFeatherLapelPin.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Wolf Clothing Co.** Gold Feather Lapel Pin, *Value $20*

<br>

A gold lapel pin, how fancy. The feather resembles that of a feather pen, so it fits perfectly with the box's theme.

<br>

[![Urban Professor Matra Journal](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxSeptember2016UrbanProfessorMantraJournal.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Urban Professor** Matra Journal, *Value $20*

<br>

This journal looks and feels luxe. The wording on the front cover has the statement, "Never Confuse Movement with Action." Wise words indeed.

<br>

[![Urban Professor Matra Journal](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxSeptember2016UrbanProfessorMantraJournal02.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

Inside of the notebook are lined pages as shown above. It's quite thick so there are a lot of pages, enough for your creative writing and ideas.

[![Gentlemen Essentials Lion Head Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxSeptember2016GentlemanEssentialsLionHeadBracelet.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Gentlemen Essentials** Lion Head Bracelet, *Value $19*

I'm having a major crush on this bracelet and am seriously thinking of keeping this for myself instead of giving it to my husband! The bracelet is composed of beads that are made of glass and metal, and it's stretchable for ease of wear and comfort.

<br>

[![Gentlemen Essentials Lion Head Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxSeptember2016GentlemanEssentialsLionHeadBracelet02.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

The main pendant is a gold lion head which symbolizes ferocity and strength. It's pretty well made and the gold and black definitely makes a great combo.

<br>

[![Gentlemen Essentials Lion Head Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxSeptember2016GentlemanEssentialsLionHeadBracelet03.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

On the other end is a golden owl which represents wisdom, something we can all be so fortunate to have.

Not only is the look on-trend and can be unisex too, it also has symbols with positive vibes. This is one awesome bracelet!

<br>

[![Architect For Men Shampoo](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxSeptember2016ArchitectForMenShampoo.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Architect For Men** Shampoo, *$bonus*

This is a bonus item so the value was not included.

As far as shampoo goes, there's not a lot out there that cater to men so it's always refreshing when I see one. This shampoo uses cleansing agents derived from natural resources and will help to break down excess oil in hair. It has a woody and amber scent in my opinion, very manly and sexy. Can't wait for my husband to try this out!

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** This month's box was filled with items that are functional and on-trend. The bracelet is definitely a favorite and has already been worn as soon as it was unboxed. It's also refreshing that this time around there were no ties or pocket squares which they typically include, and although my husband does love receiving them, sometimes it's nice to dicover other products too. Next box will be in October and I can't wait to see what theme they come up with!
