This is my first time to review this subscription box and I'm excited! I love to switch up my jewelry frequently so this will be perfect for me.

<br>

When you first sign up, you're invited to complete their Style Quiz so they get a better sense of your jewelry preferences and style.

First you state your metal preference and the types of jewelry you wear most often:

[![Cate & Chloe VIP Style Quiz](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateAndChloeStyleQuiz.png)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

<br>

Then you pick out the styles of jewelry that you love from a variety of choices:

[![Cate & Chloe VIP Style Quiz](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateAndChloeStyleQuiz2.png)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

This style question goes on to necklaces and earrings as well. I found this to be really helpful and promising to know that they just might get my fashion sense to the dot.

Now let's start unboxing!

<br>

<b>This review is for the Full VIP Status box.</b>

<br>

[![First look at unboxing](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateAndChloeVIPJune2016OpenBox.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

First look at unboxing reveals their pretty packaging. All wrapped up with a mesmerizing star patterned tissue paper!

<br>

[![Second look at unboxing](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateAndChloeVIPJune2016OpenBox2.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

Under the tissue paper, a welcome card appears! Hello VIP indeed!

<br>

The Welcome Card:

On the back of the card you'll find details of the jewelry you received. I can't wait to see them!

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe VIP June 2016 Makeup Bag](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateAndChloeVIPJune2016MakeupBag.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

All packages come with a special signature Cate & Chloe travel make up bag, and this month's bag comes with a motivational "good vibes" statement. Its simple design and pink font fits right into my style.

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe VIP June 2016 Jewelry Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateAndChloeVIPJune2016JewelryBox.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

Cate & Chloe sends their jewelry items in these cute boxes (or in jewelry bags if the item doesn't fit). It definitely makes a difference to find your jewelry packaged in cute and functional boxes versus a cheap and regular plastic packaging. So I commend them for that!

<br>

<H4>And here are my items for this month:</H4>

[![Cate & Chloe VIP June 2016 Items](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateAndChloeVIPJune2016Items.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

[![Cate & Chloe Bridget Tenacious Wrap Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateAndChloeVIPJune2016BridgetTenaciousWrapBracelet.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

**Bridget "Tenacious" Wrap Bracelet**, *Value $59*

*Size: 39cm from end to end of PVC leather*

<br>

Wrap bracelets are totally in style right now and this leather bracelet is just that. This bracelet came with a jewelry bag instead of the box due to its size.

<br>

Here it is on me:

[![Cate & Chloe Bridget Tenacious Wrap Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateAndChloeVIPJune2016BridgetTenaciousWrapBracelet2.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

Although the bracelet looks somewhat loose on me, that's only because I have tiny petite wrists. This will definitely fit ~~regular~~ standard women's wrist. Trust me, mine are not normal. 

I totally like the style (edgy and yet chic) and the brown leather will definitely go with any outfit. You can wear this alone or layer with your other bracelets or watch for that ultra trendy multi-layered look!

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe Selena Divine Layered Turquoise Necklace](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateAndChloeVIPJune2016SelenaDivineLayeredTurquoiseNecklace.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

**Selena "Divine" Layered Turquoise Necklace**, *Value $59*

*Size: Shorter chain = 17", Longer chain = 18" with 3" extender*

<br>

Turquoise is one of my favorite colors so I was happy to see this necklace with turquoise beads on them! This necklace comes in both gold and silver, but I received gold as that is my preferred choice of metal. 

<br>

Here's the necklace in all its glory:

[![Cate & Chloe Selena Divine Layered Turquoise Necklace](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateAndChloeVIPJune2016SelenaDivineLayeredTurquoiseNecklace2.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

The gold disks and layered look are totally my style. Plus this way I just have to wear 1 necklace instead of 2. How convenient!

<br>

[![Cate & Chloe Isabella Diamond Simulated Hoop Earrings](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/CateAndChloeVIPJune2016IsabellaDiamondSimulatedHoopEarrings.jpg)](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=871946&U=1115177&M=49865&urllink=){:target="_blank"}

**Isabella Diamond Simulated Hoop Earrings - 1.62"**, *Value $119*

*Product Dimensions: 1.625"L x 1.625"H x 0.125"W*

<br>

I love love love hoop earrings, it's a must have in my jewelry collection! And a girl can't just have one right, I mean they come in all different styles and sizes ;) So I'm totally happy I received these gorgeous earrings!

These hoop earrings are plated in 14k gold that feature channel-set diamond simulated crystal stones along the front and inside of the hoops.

<br>

The inside setting gives these earrings a multi-dimensional look of bling that's really unique and new to me. I love it! I'm just bedazzled by these, I can't wait to wear them!


<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** My first experience with Cate & Chloe VIP was pretty awesome. I loved the different styles of jewelry I received and really appreciated that they were packaged in jewelry boxes and bags. And on top of that I also received a cool makeup bag. I definitely felt that all the items in total were worth way way more than the $39.99 cost. Everything was quality and on trend! If you're a jewelry addict (such as myself), then try their subscription and see how quickly you're jewelry collection will grow! Time to dazzle ladies!
