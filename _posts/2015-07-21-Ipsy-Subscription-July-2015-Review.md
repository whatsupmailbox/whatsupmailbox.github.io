<p>Ipsy always ships their bags in bright neon pink padded envelops. You can see them a mile away! ;)</p>

<p>Ipsy is very similar to Birchbox where all subscribers receive different variations in their bag, and is mostly dependant on your preferences. They try to give you products that match your needs and concerns so not everyone will get the same items.</p>

<p>This review is for my profile so it's just one of the many variations that they sent out.</p>

<p>Every month Ipsy sends their items in makeup bags that they produce exclusively, and lately the bags have been getting better and better both in quality and design. Keep it up Ipsy!</p>

<p>For July, their theme is <big>"Summer Lovin"</big></p>
<br>

<H4>Items in Detail:</H4>

<DT><a href="https://www.coolwayhair.com/ProductDetail.aspx?pid=131" target="_blank">Coolway Beachy Salt Spray</a></DT>
<DD>Travel size 15 ml, Value $2</DD>
</DL>

<p>Sea salt sprays are in trend for summer, I mean who doesn't want to have "just came back from the beach" hair look. But this way you don't even have to go to the beach if you don't have one nearby, minus the sun damage too.</p>
<p>This spray promises beachy curls that's both matte and non-sticky, and it's formulated with Dead Sea salts for additional mineral nourishment.</p>

<DD>Full Size, Value $4.99</DD>
</DL>

<p>I can never have enough eyeshadows so I was happy to find this item in my bag, thanks Ipsy! The colors match my skin tone and is versatile where I can wear it lightly for daytime and heavy for night.</p>

<DD>Full Size, Value $14</DD>
</DL>

<p>Another item that I can never have enough of, lip balms!</p>

<DD>Travel Size 3 g/.11 oz, Value $10</DD>

<p>I'm already a huge Tarte fan and I actually have this bronzer in full size, so I was ecstatic to get a travel size version of this. </p>

<DL>
<DT>Altchek MD Eye Gel Pads</DT>
<DD>2 treatments, Retail Value $4</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm a sucker for eye pads and was super happy to get 2 treatments. I work late and am constantly staring at the computer for both my job and blog, so my eyes need all the help they can get. Plus I love doing impromptu spa days at home and this is perfect for that.</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I think <a href="https://www.ipsy.com/new?refer=uns8d" target="_blank">Ipsy</a> did a great job in matching the items this month to my profile. My least favorite item would have to be the bag -I thought it was just okay, nothing special. The total value came up to $36.65 which is great for a $10 subscription, especially when every single item in this bag is useful to me. When compared to <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Birchbox</a>, I think Ipsy has something different to deliver -they send out a lot of full size items and a free bag. I subscribe to both and will continue to do so. Here's to hoping they get it right again next month!</p>
