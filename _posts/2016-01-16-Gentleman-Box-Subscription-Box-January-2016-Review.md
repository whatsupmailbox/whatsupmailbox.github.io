<p>I always like watches with clean design, not only for aesthetics, but also because it can then fit into any outfit.</p>

<p>My husband absolutely loves Happy Socks. They always have fun and sometimes bright patterns or designs for each pair of socks.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I'm happy with this month's box and it surely met all my expectations. I definitely appreciate the inclusion of a wristwatch, but even more grateful that it also includes two additional interchangeable straps. Especially the camo pattern, a clear favorite. In all honesty, I had secretly hopes that the watch would fit my petite wrist, but my husband can claim this all for himself. The total value of this box came up to $xxx which is amazing for the $25 cost of this box.</p>
