## Items in details

<DL>
<DT><b>Epicuren Discovery</b> Green Tea & Seaweed Soothing Mask</DT>
<DD>Full Size 2.5 oz., Value $50</DD>
</DL>

<p><i>Note: This mask tube came with an inside foil seal.</i></p>

<br>

<p>I'm happy that I received a mask as I know I can always use them. Plus I've never heard of Epicuren Discovery before so I'm excited to try them out.</p>

<p>"This Aloe Vera based mask contains Sea Clay to nourish and purify the skin, while soothing Seaweed and Green Tea work to instantly comfort and diminish visual redness. The Green Tea & Seaweed Soothing Mask is recommended for all skin types, especially for those with sensitive or inflamed skin conditions."</p>

<p>And with every box they send out, they include a Beauty Report about the product and why it was matched for you (me):</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This month's product match although not a complete match, wasn't too bad. I can always use another mask and the value is double the cost of the box which is great. Last month's value was quite low so I'm happy with this month's value for sure. One thing to note about this subscription (and other subscriptions for that matter) is that although you may fill out your beauty profile to the tee in terms of what you're looking for and what you'd like to avoid, they can't always completely deliver that but they try their best. So keep that in mind if you're thinking of subscribing.</p>
