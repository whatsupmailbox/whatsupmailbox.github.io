<p>They also send a postcard in every monthly package. The picture above also includes some stickers from the package. The outer space themed stickers are on clear velum and there's also 2 stamp-sized stickers of cats.</p>

<p>These stickers are great for my planner. I can even use some of them as gift labels!</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I really enjoyed my first package from them! All the greeting cards were of high quality and the designs are totally usable for me. I especially loved this month's inclusion of a wooden stamp, I can forsee that being used quite frequently. With so many cards plus the stamp, the value for me personally is way above the $15 cost, so that was a win. I've committed to a 12-month subscription and I can honestly say that I'm happy I did so. I'll have a good collection of stationary now and won't need to rush to the store for a last minute greeting card situation that I tend to find myself in quite often. So happy I subscribed to this!</p>
