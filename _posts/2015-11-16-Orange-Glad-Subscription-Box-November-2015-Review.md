<p>Upon unboxing, the first visible sight is of a small info booklet:</p>

<H4>And here are the items inside the November 2015 box:</H4>

<p>I see a Toffee theme going on, and although I'm not a big fan of it, it still looks delicious enough for me to try!</p>

<p>The chocolate bar's packaging already makes me so happy, plus it's quite a big bar so I can't wait to open this up!</p>

<p>This salted toffee tastes both sweet and slightly salty as the name suggests. It's very slight in saltiness though so don't worry if this combo sounds too weird for you. I found it more sweet so you'll still satisfy that sweet tooth craving. It was also slightly crunchy and had caramel as well, but not too much, just enough to give it some chewy texture.</p>

<p>Okay, so I must confess, I'm not a big fan of caramel as well. I can handle some, but not when it's full caramel. So I had my husband try this on my behalf, he didn't mind either and was happy to oblige.</p>

<p>The packaging is cool and retro, I always appreciate a good package, it resonates well with me and shows that the company cares about aesthetics too and not just the actual product.</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Orange Glad is a great subscription if you want to try out some artisinal sweets that are unique. I think they do have a monthly theme in which they curate their treats, and although I'm not a big fan of toffee which is the theme of this month, I still enjoyed the treats and will continue subscribing.</p>
