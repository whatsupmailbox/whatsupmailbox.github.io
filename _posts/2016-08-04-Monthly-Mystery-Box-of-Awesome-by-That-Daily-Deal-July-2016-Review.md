**Subscription:** [Monthly Mystery Box of Awesome by That Daily Deal](http://www.thatdailydeal.com/home.php?id=18483){:target="_blank"}

**Cost:** $24.99/month for the Standard Box or $34.98/month for the Deluxe Box + Free Shipping to the U.S.

**What's in the box:** Every month you will receive an exclusive mystery box with goodies ONLY for the people on the monthly mystery box program.

<br>

[Monthly Mystery Box of Awesome](http://www.thatdailydeal.com/home.php?id=18483){:target="_blank"} is a subscription box that sends out items that are a complete mystery as they don't have a theme, don't cater specifically to women or men, and although they try to send items relevant to the season, it's not guaranteed and again, a complete mystery as to what you'll receive. But you will always receive FAR more in retail value than what you are paying every month, so delight on that fact.

I found this to be so exciting and fun, and I've seen some pretty good reviews of it so I decided to try them out!

First look at unboxing and all I could focus on is that weird Hot Wheels, lol! I did buy some mystery add-ons during checkout (they offer these $.98 mystery add-ons right before you complete your purchase) and I'm guessing this has to be one of them. More info on that later!

Every month, they do a promotion of one (or more) people receiving SUPER boxes. This month 11 people received Drones and next month at least 20 people will receive a 3D Virtual Headset. Knowing my luck, I'll probably never receive a SUPER box. #icanonlywish

<H4>And here are all the items in July's mystery box:</H4>

**Hammock with Travel Bag**

<br>

This item was revealed to be in the box prior, so I knew I was getting this. My husband and I go ~~camping~~ glamping every now and then, so this will surely be a treat to prop up and lounge under the trees with a book and a glass of wine. I need to plan a trip asap.

**Contour 3-in-1 Massage Pillow**

<br>

This was certainly unexpected! It's a memory foam pillow that contours for your legs either laying down or sideways.

<br>

You see this info sheet in the box and I definitely agree with number 1, it did have quite a strong odor when I first opened the pillow packaging. I'm sure that will dissipate after a couple of days, hopefully.

This is how it looks like all layed out flat.

The power and option button is located at the bottom side on each end.

<br>

And here's how it looks on my legs:

It felt comfortable and it did vibrate/massage nicely. I'm more of a deep-tissue massage kind of girl so although it probably won't kneed and relax my muscles as much as I would want it to (I'm pretty sure no device can), it will certainly function enough to provide some comfort for those days when my calves/legs feel overused.

**KP Industries Raft Air Pump**

<br>

This is an air pump that you can use to inflate all your outdoor or indoor inflatables. From air-beds to pool loungers, you name it. I already have one that I love so I'm not sure if I'll be using this right away, but it's good to have a spare just in case.

**Lighting Science Basics LED Light Bulbs**

<br>

LED light bulbs, ummm ok (I guess). I can't say I'm too excited but I could always use some light bulbs. This went straight into my supply closet!

<br>

**My Add-Ons:**

As I mentioned earlier, I did buy some mystery add-ons to this month's box, 3 to be exact. So the following items are not part of the Mystery Box subscription, just so you know.

**Zoomies Hands-Free Binoculars**

This looked really weird at first when I took it out of the box. But I was being a good sport so I put these on (
