![Monthly Mystery Box of Awesome by That Daily Deal](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/monthly-mystery-box-of-awesome-by-that-daily-deal-july-2016-Package.jpg)

**Subscription:** [Monthly Mystery Box of Awesome by That Daily Deal](http://www.thatdailydeal.com/home.php?id=18483){:target="_blank"}

**Cost:** $24.99/month for the Standard Box or $34.98/month for the Deluxe Box + Free Shipping to the U.S.

**What's in the box:** Every month you will receive an exclusive mystery box with goodies ONLY for the people on the monthly mystery box program.

<br>

[Monthly Mystery Box of Awesome](http://www.thatdailydeal.com/home.php?id=18483){:target="_blank"} is a subscription box that sends out items that are a complete mystery as they don't have a theme, don't cater specifically to women or men, and although they try to send items relevant to the season, it's not guaranteed and again, a complete mystery as to what you'll receive. But you will always receive FAR more in retail value than what you are paying every month, so delight on that fact.

I found this to be so exciting and fun, and I've seen some pretty good reviews of it so I decided to try them out!

<br>

First look at unboxing and all I could focus on is that weird Hot Wheels, lol! I did buy some mystery add-ons during checkout (they offer these $.98 mystery add-ons right before you complete your purchase) and I'm guessing this has to be one of them. More info on that later!

<br>

Every month, they do a promotion of one (or more) people receiving SUPER boxes. This month 11 people received Drones and next month at least 20 people will receive a 3D Virtual Headset. Knowing my luck, I'll probably never receive a SUPER box. #icanonlywish

<br>

<H4>And here are all the items in July's mystery box:</H4>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

![Monthly Mystery Box of Awesome by That Daily Deal](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/monthly-mystery-box-of-awesome-by-that-daily-deal-july-2016-hammock.jpg)

**Ultra Light Parachute Hammock w/ Built In Travel Bag** *Value $12.49  ([13deals.com](http://www.13deals.com/store/products/37872-ultra-light-parachute-hammock-w-built-in-travel-bag-with-exclusive-secret-in-cart-deals-ships-free){:target="_blank"})*

<br>

This item was revealed to be in the box prior, so I knew I was getting this. My husband and I go ~~camping~~ glamping every now and then, so this will surely be a treat to prop up and lounge under the trees with a book and a glass of wine. I need to plan a trip asap.

<br>

![Monthly Mystery Box of Awesome by That Daily Deal](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/monthly-mystery-box-of-awesome-by-that-daily-deal-july-2016-contour-3-in-1-massage-pillow.jpg)

**Contour 3-in-1 Massage Pillow**, *Value $12.45 ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/GetSet2Save-Contour-3-in-1-Massage-Pillow/dp/B00SBOIGJ4){:target="_blank"})*

<br>

This was certainly unexpected! It's a memory foam pillow that contours for your legs either laying down or sideways.

<br>

![Monthly Mystery Box of Awesome by That Daily Deal](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/monthly-mystery-box-of-awesome-by-that-daily-deal-july-2016-contour-3-in-1-massage-pillow-info.jpg)

You see this info sheet in the box and I definitely agree with number 1, it did have quite a strong odor when I first opened the pillow packaging. I'm sure that will dissipate after a couple of days, hopefully.

<br>

This is how it looks like all layed out flat.

<br>

The power and option button is located at the bottom side on each end.

<br>

And here's how it looks on my legs:

<br>

It felt comfortable and it did vibrate/massage nicely. I'm more of a deep-tissue massage kind of girl so although it probably won't kneed and relax my muscles as much as I would want it to (I'm pretty sure no device can), it will certainly function enough to provide some comfort for those days when my calves/legs feel overused.

![Monthly Mystery Box of Awesome by That Daily Deal](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/monthly-mystery-box-of-awesome-by-that-daily-deal-july-2016-kp-industries-raft-air-pump.jpg)

**KP Industries Raft Air Pump**, *Value $14.99 (Ebay)*

<br>

This is an air pump that you can use to inflate all your outdoor or indoor inflatables. From rafts to air-beds to pool loungers, you name it. I already have one that I love so I'm not sure if I'll be using this right away, but it's good to have a spare just in case.

<br>

![Monthly Mystery Box of Awesome by That Daily Deal](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/monthly-mystery-box-of-awesome-by-that-daily-deal-july-2016-lighting-science-basics-led-bulbs.jpg)

**Lighting Science Basics LED Light Bulbs**, *Value $14.99 ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Lighting-Science-Equivalent-Non-Dimmable-4-Pack/dp/B0175I79RQ){:target="_blank"})*

<br>

LED light bulbs, ummm ok (I guess). I can't say I'm too excited but I could always use some light bulbs. This went straight into my supply closet!

<br>

**My Add-Ons:**

As I mentioned earlier, I did buy some mystery add-ons to this month's box, 3 to be exact. So the following items are not part of the Mystery Box subscription, just so you know.

<br>

![Monthly Mystery Box of Awesome by That Daily Deal](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/monthly-mystery-box-of-awesome-by-that-daily-deal-july-2016-zoomies-hands-free-binoculars.jpg)

**Zoomies Hands-Free Binoculars**, *Value $9.50 ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/As-Seen-On-TV-ZM013124/dp/B00DVQF1F4){:target="_blank"})*

This looked really weird at first when I took it out of the box. But I was being a good sport so I put these on (away from any living person who can possible see me in these). 

<br>

![Monthly Mystery Box of Awesome by That Daily Deal](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/monthly-mystery-box-of-awesome-by-that-daily-deal-july-2016-zoomies-hands-free-binoculars-02.jpg)

You adjust the strength through the side knobs (both left and right) and there's even a sliding switch inside that makes the lenses tinted, they call it sunglasses mode. #lol

They definitely magnify and act as binoculars. You can't see really far though, but it is pretty nifty and cool. I just don't think I'll be using this in public. My husband on the other hand has no issues with it so it's safe to say, he can have this.

<br>

**Hot Wheels DC Comics Dream Van XGW**, *Value $5.35* ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Hot-Wheels-DC-Comics-Darkseid/dp/B008SAWIL8){:target="_blank"})*

<br>

I know this is a mystery box, but man oh man, this was a shocker to receive (at least for me)! Thankfully I have friends who have children and can gift it to them.

<br>

![Monthly Mystery Box of Awesome by That Daily Deal](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/monthly-mystery-box-of-awesome-by-that-daily-deal-july-2016-dcule-pocket-lamp-03.jpg)

**dcule 5 x LED Pocket Lamp**, *Value $3.02 ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Pocket-Credit-Card-Wallet-Light/dp/B0055S41CA){:target="_blank"})*

This is a pocket lamp in a size of a credit card. It's very compact that you can slip it in your wallet for when you need emergency light. The silhoutte looks like a light bulb and you flip that up to turn on the light.

<br>

![Monthly Mystery Box of Awesome by That Daily Deal](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/monthly-mystery-box-of-awesome-by-that-daily-deal-july-2016-dcule-pocket-lamp-04.jpg)

You can lay it flat on a surface or carry it around with you as some sort of flashlight. It's very lightweight and easy to grip.

<br>

Here's how it looks in the dark:

<br>

![Monthly Mystery Box of Awesome by That Daily Deal](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/monthly-mystery-box-of-awesome-by-that-daily-deal-july-2016-dcule-pocket-lamp-05.jpg)

I wouldn't say it was really bright, but for the size, it's pretty good and looks cool. Plus it was part of the $.98 mystery add on so this is totally worth that price!

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** My first Mystery Box and I can honestly say I have a bit of mixed feelings about it. On one hand, I knew that I would get the hammock and that made the cost of the box somewhat justifiable. On the other hand, I'm not so sure I enjoy the other items. I can certainly find use in them and will use them eventually. The total value also outdid the cost so at least I'm happy with that. I guess this month's items were just not up my alley. I've seen what they've sent in previous months and loved them, so hopefully this month was just a bit of a dud and next month's box will be better. Fingers crossed!
