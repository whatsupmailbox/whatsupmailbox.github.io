[![DIY Shoe Brush & Rag Seet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxAugust2016DIYPureBristlesShoeBrushRagSet.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**DIY** Shoe Brush & Rag Set, *Value $10*

This set comes with a shoe brush, a rag and a black drawstring pouch to keep it all together.

<br>

The shoe brush is made of pure bristles and the size is just right to handle comfortably. Receiving this now, I think I'll lovingly hint to my husband that it's time for him to shine a few of his shoes.

<br>

[![Knottery New York Neck Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxAugust2015KnotteryNewYorkNeckTie.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Knottery New York** Neck Tie, *Value $55*

What a bright popping color for a tie! Definitely bold in color and one that my husband most likely does not have yet.

<br>

[![Knottery New York Neck Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxAugust2015KnotteryNewYorkNeckTie02.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

This tie is made of 100% silk, hence the hefty value, and it's dry clean only. It has a bit of a sheen to it, and although the picture probably doesn't show it, but the color is more green than blue. Either way, my husband loves getting silk ties, it's a luxury accessory that a gentleman should always have.

<br>

[![Sprezza Pocket Square](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxAugust2016SprezzaPocketSquare.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Sprezza** Pocket Square, *Value $18*

A white pocket square is as versatile as you can get. It will go along with just about any suit you may have and the blue frame adds that hint of color to complete the look.

<br>

[![Stesso Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxAugust2016StessoSocks.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Stesso** Socks, *Value $12*

I say this all the time, but my husband can never have enough socks. He loves all the different patterns and colors that he's been getting in subscription boxes and boy has his collection grew! 

These socks have a soft feel to it with just the right amount of thickness. It's mostly made of cotton with some nylon and spandex for elasticity and durability. Another great sock to add to the collection!

<br>

[![Bickmore Bick1 Leather Cleaner](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxAugust2016BickmoreBick1LeatherCleaner.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**Bickmore** Bick1 Leather Cleaner, *Value $5*

This leather cleaner is to be used with the shoe brush and rag set that's included in this box. "Bick 1 is an aggressive cleaner for smooth leather. It has been proven to remove soil, grease, spur marks, and most food and ink stains."

<br>

[![The Mens Shoe Club Shoe Lace](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SprezzaBoxAugust2016TheMensShoeClubShoeLace.jpg)](http://www.sprezzabox.com?rfsn=103516.e98b8){:target="_blank"}

**The Mens Shoe Club** Shoe Lace, *Value $5*

Shoe laces are something that my husband rarely buys and honestly I think it doesn't cross his mind to change any of his shoe laces. So this will definitely motivate him to start doing so. Especially those vintage leather shoes he has with old looking laces, I think these will go great in them.

FYI, [The Mens Shoe Club](http://themensshoeclub.myshopify.com){:target="_blank"} is actually a shoe subscription for men that sends out premium leather shoes to your door every month.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** This month had items that were very functional. Everything will surely be used and although it felt a bit lacking in the wow factor as I typically am with this box, it still had its high value. The total value of everything in this box came up to $105, which is exactly the same as last month's, but the items were definitely more up my alley then versus now. The silk tie was the definite winner in this box and made the cost totally worth it. Here's to hoping next month will bring more exciting items!
