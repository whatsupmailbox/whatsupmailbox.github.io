<p>I'm always happy when my Popsugar box arrives, especially since this year they've sent out 2 great boxes so far. I was quite anxious to open this up to see what was inside!</p>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Nanette Nanette Lepore</b> Classic Rose Gold Watch</DT>
<DD>Value $55</DD>
</DL>

<p>This item was revealed to be included in the box prior and I was quite excited to be receiving a watch! I've only received one watch in a subscription box before and that was from <a href="http://fbuy.me/cJCZ1" target="_blank">Rachel Zoe's Box Of Style</a>, so this will happily be added into my watch collection.</p>

<br>

<p>Here's a closer look at the watch face:</p>

<br>

<img src="/images/PopsugarMar2016NanetteNannetteLeporeClassicRoseGoldWatch2.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" />
</a></center>

<p>The design of the watch is simple yet feminine and chic. I love watches with white face dials and when you pair that with rose gold, it's a perfect match. At least for me.</p>

<br>

<p>Here's a look at the watch on me:</p>

<br>

</a></center>

<p>Although I do wear an Apple Watch everyday, I like to switch it up sometimes as it doesn't always match my outfit. This looks great on me and I can't wait to wear this out!</p>

<br>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Miss Ivy Pearl</b> Five-Tassel Necklace</DT>
<DD>Value $38</DD>
</DL>

<p>I'm not sure if it's just me but this design is either totally fashionable or down right plain weird. I myself think it looks kind of weird, at least on me when I tried it on. Maybe it's just not my style. It's a definite pass and will be gifted.</p>

<br>

<p>Here's a closer look at the tassels:</p>

<br>

<center><a href="https://musthave.popsugar.com/p/monthly-subscription?utm_source=link&utm_medium=confirmation-page&utm_campaign=referral&utm_content=u:16301514" target="_blank">
<img src="/images/PopsugarMar2016MissIvyPearlFiveTasselNecklace2.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" />
</a></center>

<p>I actually have necklaces with tassels, but the tassels are made of leather for a rocker chic look which is more my style. These tassels are made of different shades of teal threads which I think will look great for spring or summer. I'm sure some gals would love this and it just might be they're next favorite bauble, but sadly not for me.</p>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Pixi by Petra</b> Book of Beauty, Minimal Makeup</DT>
<DD>Value $24</DD>
</DL>

<p>This is a palette of two highlighters, two cheek tints and four eye shadows. I have so many of these already that I decided to gift this hence why I didn't open it for pictures.</p>

<p>There's actually 3 types of Book of Beauty by Pixi. There's a Touch of Blush, Contour Creator and this Minimal Makeup. I kind of wished we got the Contour Creator but the editors probably decided to go with Minimal Makeup because it's a combination of products for an all-in-one palette.</p>

<br>

<center><a href="https://musthave.popsugar.com/p/monthly-subscription?utm_source=link&utm_medium=confirmation-page&utm_campaign=referral&utm_content=u:16301514" target="_blank">
<img src="/images/PopsugarMar2016PixiByPetraBookOfBeauty2.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" />
</a></center>

<p>The brand Pixi itself is quite good, and I have some items from them that I use so I know these will probably have the same quality. Who knows, I may end up using it in the end ;)</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Hello</b> Extra Whitening Fluoride Toothpaste</DT>
<DD>Value $4.49</DD>
</DL>

<p>First off, the packaging looks cool and I'm already loving this toothpaste. Then as I opened the box, I'm pleasantly happy that the toothpaste tube itself is also silver and looks cool as well. And not only is it good in looks, it's also good in ingredients. No preservative or artificial sweetener. I was actually unboxing this as I was packing and getting ready for my trip to Europe last week and it went straight into my suitcase. I have now used it daily and must say that this is my favorite toothpaste now and I will definitely be buying more!</p>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Govino</b> Go-Anywhere Carafe and Water Glass Set</DT>
<DD>Value $14.95</DD>
</DL>

<p>So I actually have this set already but the one I have is labeled as Wine Decanter and Wine Glass set. This one specifically says Water Glass so the marketing is different but it's the exact same products.</p>

<p>I tried finding this Water Glass labeling on their website and couldn't find any, so I'm guessing they want to diversify their marketing so that it's not limited to only wine drinkers. I think that's a smart move as these glasses are so very useful and non wine drinkers would be able to find them easier if it wasn't specifically labeled as wine glasses.</p>

<br>

<p>I didn't open this because I already have a set and don't really need two, but again, who knows, I may encounter a need in the future for a second set especially during a summer bbq/pool party.</p>

<br>

<p>Here's how it looks from their website:</p>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT><b>Goodie Girl Cookies</b> Toffee Chaos</DT>
<DD>Value $5</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love toffee and these tastes great! They're crunchy, sweet and gluten-free too. It's also kosher and peanut-free. I was reading their description and saw that they suggest making ice cream sandwiches with these, I am so going to try that out, my mouth is already salivating just picturing it, slurp.</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>My Lola</b> Free Box Gift Card</DT>
<DD>Value $10</DD>
</DL>

<p>My Lola is a subscription for tampons that are 100% cotton — which means they're 100% natural, 100% biodegradable, and 100% easy to feel good about. Can't wait to try this!</p>

<p><i>Note: Each card has a unique redeption code. Offer valid through 4/30/16. Valid on one-box orders only. New customers only. One per customer.</i></p> 

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I liked everything in this box except the necklace which is still fine since I can gift that. The total value came up to $151.44, almost quadruple the cost. I think this box had a spring theme to it based on the items and colors, spring spring here we come! My favorites from this box has got to be the watch, which made a great addition to my watch collection, and also the toothpaste which is now the only toothpaste I will ever use. Another good box from Popsugar, yay!</p>
