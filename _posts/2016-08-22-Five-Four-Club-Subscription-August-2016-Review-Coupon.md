**Boswell Navy Shirt**

This is a nice and classic dress shirt that is just my husband's style. Plus it's made of 100% cotton!

<br>

The small checkered pattern is perfect for just about any occasion. You can dress it up or dress it down, and the color is versatile too so it will go great as we transition to fall.

<br>

Here's how it looks on:

My husband loves getting dress shirts in his [Five Four Club](http://fivefourclub.7eer.net/c/164125/122548/2570){:target="_blank"} packages, and he will surely use this for many years to come.

**Giovane Khaki Twill Slim Pant**

Getting pants in this month's package definitely feels like hitting the jackpot! It's not often that they send them out hence it deserves a happy dance whenever it does occur.

<br>

It has two side front pockets and made of 97% cotton and 3% spandex for elasticity.

The branding is at the back side and it's ever so small which is perfect as my husband dislikes clothing with big apparent logos on them.

The back side also has two pockets that can be enclosed with buttons. 

<br>

Here's how it looks on:

As you can see, it matches the shirt and although it's a "slim" pant fit, it still had some room, so it wasn't too tight. My husband said that he definitely felt comfortable wearing it and loves the whole look.

**Fairway Dad Navy Hat**

I think this is the first hat that they've ever sent us. My husband wears a lot of hats since we live in California were it's almost always sunny so this was happily received. Although it does have a pretty big branding on it, it's not too obnoxious so my husband is comfortable wearing it.

<br>

[![Five Four Club Fairway Dad Navy Hat](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/FiveFourClubAugust2016FairwayDadHatNavy02.jpg)](http://fivefourclub.7eer.net/c/164125/122548/2570){:target="_blank"}

There is a "Five Four" stitching on the back side of the hat and you can see that it's also adjustable.

The inside has Five Four allover and you can also see that small holes are incorporated into the design so that it's breathable.

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This month's items were a perfect transition as we move into fall. Although I might not really categorize them as "fashion forward", they were still items that matched my husband's style and he will surely wear it all. For the price I paid, it's still a great deal, especially since I received pants which is always a big plus. This subscription has truly helped my husband in keeping on trend and not having to go out shopping for clothes since that's probably the least favorite thing for him to do. So if that sounds like you too, I'd say try them out, especially since they have an amazing coupon going on right now.
