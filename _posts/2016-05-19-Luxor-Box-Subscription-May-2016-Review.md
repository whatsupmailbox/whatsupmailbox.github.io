<p>Luxor Box is one of those luxurious subscription boxes that I'm in love with. I always find luxe household items and jewelry that I never would have owned or purchased had it not been for this box.</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxMay2016Package.jpg"></center>
<p>They always ship their boxes inside a bigger white and unmarked box. This way your package is safe from prying eyes. I love that, especially since there's been an increase in mail theft nowadays.</p>
<br>

<p>Upon opening the white box, you see the actual Luxor Box inside.</p>

<br>

<p>As soon as you open the box, you see their info cards. Each item is represented by a card that details the brand/company, the actual item itself and the value. Sometimes there's even a coupon too!</p>

<H4>And here are the items inside:</H4>

<p>I laid out all the items on my own personal silver tray for the purpose of this picture, so no, that was not part of the box =)</p>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxMay2016Jesse&CoLeatherBeautifulWordPouch2.jpg"></center>

<p>This pouch is made of genuine leather and it's so buttery soft. I love the color and obviously the word "Beautiful" on it. It's happy, bright and small enough to fit inside a larger bag.</p>

<p>It is quite a high-valued pouch though and personally I would never have paid full price for this, and thankfully I didn't.</p>

<br>

<p>Here's a look inside of the pouch:</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxMay2016Jesse&CoLeatherBeautifulWordPouch3.jpg"></center>

<p>The inside is not lined so it has the same color as the outside, which is just fine for me. I'm also happy that this was Made in the USA!</p>

<p>This vase is 4.75" in height and made of 18/8 Stainless Steel. It's part of her classic Core Collection of hand-hammered stainless steel houseware and it's just gorgeous.</p>

<br>

<p>Here's a look at the vase from above:</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxMay2016MaryJurekDesignMirabelMiniVase3.jpg"></center>

<p>As you can see, it's got a skinny design which is quite unique. This definitely fits in with my home decor and will look beautiful by itself or with flowers in it.</p>

<p>OMG, I am head over heels for this tumbler! First off, I love everything French and I've been wanting to get some Rose et Marius products for awhile now so I was ecstatic when I found out that Luxor Box will including this item for this month's box.</p>

<p>The colors and design are just gorgeous. I've been looking at what other subscribers received from social media, and I secretly wished to get this design. I love pink so this was a total match for me and I'm so lucky I got this!</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxMay2016RoseEtMariusPreciousTumbler3.jpg"></center>

<p>The branding is evident inside the tumbler.</p>

<p>Some info about the brand and what inspired their tumbler designs. I can't believe that this is made of porcelain with platinum finish, how luxurious! It is also entirely handmade in France and can be used as a cup or filled with a candle. I think I'll be purchasing both their candle and diffuser that fits inside of this tumbler. You can also use pretty much any candle that fits inside. When you put a candle inside, it will illuminate through the design, projecting a pretty glow from inside of the tumbler. I can't wait to see that!</p>

<p>The soap matches my tumbler, yay! Plus I love everything rose, how lucky am I!</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxMay2016RoseEtMariusCementTileSoap2.jpg"></center>

<p>Opening the outer box reveals the beauty of this soap. I mean look at that design!</p>

<br>

<p>This soap is so pretty and smells so good, I'm not sure I even want to use it. It'll be a great display piece in my bathroom and it will also fill the air with its lovely rose scent.</p>

<DT><b>Adornia</b> Love Lariat Necklace Silver</DT>
<DD>Value $95</DD>
</DL>

<p>This necklace actually comes in gold too and I kind of wished we got that version instead. But, even though I do prefer gold, sometimes I wear silver now and then for a certain outfit so it's not a complete lost. Plus this design is quite unique and totally up my alley in style.</p>

<br>

<p>Here's a look at the necklace on me:</p>

<br>

<center><img src="/images/LuxorBoxMay2016AdorniaLoveLariatNecklaceSilver3.jpg"></center>

<p>This can actually be worn with a low v-cut top or dress for a more dramatic appearance, but for the purpose of this review, I went conservative and wore it with a simple black maxi to display its versatility.</p>

<p>I think it looks great and will surely dress up your casual outfit. Even my husband commented, "cool necklace", which says a lot!</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Wow, wow and wow. This box was ah-mazing! I absolutely LOVED everything, great job Luxor Box! It had a good variety of products and the tumbler from Rose et Marius made this box extra special and hands down my favorite box from them ever.</p>
