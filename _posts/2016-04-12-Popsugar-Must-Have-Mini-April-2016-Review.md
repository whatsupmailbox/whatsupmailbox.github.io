<p>This is the very first box of <a href="https://musthave.popsugar.com/p/monthly-subscription?utm_source=link&utm_medium=confirmation-page&utm_campaign=referral&utm_content=u:16301514" target="_blank">Popsugar Must Have Mini</a> and I was so excited to finally unbox this! It's also the first box since Popsugar redesigned their boxes and I must say, I love how simple, clean and modern it looks. Love the new box design!</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Greenmarket Purveying Co.</b> White Melon Pantry Soy Candle</DT>
<DD>Value $16</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've been a big fan of this brand of candle since Popsugar fist introduced me to it in one of their boxes last year. The White Melon scent is so refreshing and sweet, it's absolutely perfect for summer! The glass mason-type jar is also a design which will go with just about any decor and will be reusable once your candle is all gone.</p>

<br>

<p>I love how they label the ingredients as well (all natural of course!), it adds to the mason-jar style of packaging. Great item and can't wait to start burning this candle!</p>

<DL>
<DT><b>Farmacy</b> Lip Bloom in Lavender Mint</DT>
<DD>Value $16.50</DD>
</DL>

<p>Subscribers received either Lavender Mint or Strawberry Basil.</p>

<p>I always welcome lip balms or any type of lip product for that matter, so I was happy to see this in the box.</p>

<p>The packaging is also quite unique where it unfolds to reveal some important info regarding the company and product itself.</p>

<p>The balm itself is clear and has the scent of lavender mint. It smells nice, has a nice texture and it moisturized my lips. This balm is actually available in Sephora too and got great reviews. I might just have to try their other scents as well.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> First off, I'm happy that Popsugar came out with a mini version that's completely different from their bigger box. The price point is affordable plus it promises to have a value of over $30. With that said, I did expect something more from their first launch box, like a grand opening, people expect to be wowed. I do love the product and will definitely be using them, and it would have been great if this came out as their 2nd box or 3rd, just not as their first ever box. Or am I asking too much? I did notice a farm fresh theme in the products and thought that was cute. Again, I'm totally happy with the items and both are definitely worth the price, just thought they could have done better for a launch box.</p>
