<p>When I first got the email of the launch (you can read my post about it <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/products/RiflePaperCO-LeSportsac-Collaboration/">here</a>), I knew I had to buy one asap! I'm obsessed with <a href="www.riflepaperco.com">Rifle Paper Co.</a> and what better brand to collaborate with for bags than LeSportsac.</p>

<p>After going back and forth between a few of the bags, I finally decided on purchasing a bag and added a cosmetic bag at the last minute (of course). Shipping was fast since they use Priority Mail 2-business day, and I finally have my hands on them today, yay!</p>

<p>When I first saw the package, I didn't know who or where it came from. As you can see, there's no brand packaging, just a brown box with a regular white shipping label.</p>

<p>First look into the box revealed the same features as the outer box -plain, brown and not a single indication where it came from. I was expecting more from Rifle Paper Co. being a gift wrapping company first and foremost, so this was quite disappointing.</p>

<p>After digging through a bunch of brown wrappings, I finally felt some product wrapped in the same brown paper that consumes the whole box. Very disappointing again, I mean really, brown paper? It's not a piece of meat you know.</p>

<p>Well at least my bags were beautiful so let's move on and check them out.</p>

<p>It's rare to find a bag that suits my size and yet still roomy enough for multiple products because of my petite self, so I was happy to find out that this bag suits me just fine. I was also happy to find that there are two zipped exterior pockets on the sides as well as a zipped compartment inside, great for organizing my small items such as keys, lip balms, etc.</p>

<p>The shoulder straps are adjustable and removable, both great features of course. I tested the straps by inserting some heavy items into the bag (water bottle, full cosmetic bag, wallet) and although not the most comfortable, it was still good and it did hold well.</p>

<p>The lining on both the outside and inside is with LeSportsac's signature Ripstop Nylon, so it's totally durable, repels water, and easy to clean. I like easy.<p>
