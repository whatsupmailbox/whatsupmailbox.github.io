<p>When I first got the email of the launch, I knew I had to buy one asap! I'm obsessed with <a href="www.riflepaperco.com">Rifle Paper Co.</a> and what better brand to collaborate with for bags then LeSportsac.</p>

<p>After going back and forth between a few of the bags, I finally decided on purchasing a bag and added a cosmetic bag at the last minute (of course). Shipping only took 2 business days and I finally have my hands on them today, yay!</p>

<p>When I first saw the package, I didn't know who or where it came from. As you can see, there's no brand packaging, just a brown box with a regular white shipping label.</p>

<p>First look into the box revealed the same features as the outer box -plain, brown and not a single indication where it came from. I was expecting more from Rifle Paper Co. being a gift wrapping company first and foremost, so this was quite disappointing.</p>

<p>After digging through a bunch of brown wrappings, I finally felt some product wrapped in the same brown paper that consumes the whole box. Very disappointing again, I mean really, brown paper? It's not a piece of meat you know.</p>

<p>Well at least my bags were beautiful so let's move on and check them out.</p>
