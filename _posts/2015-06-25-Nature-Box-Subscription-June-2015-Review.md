<DT>Dark Cocoa Nom Noms</DT>
<DD>Mini Cocoa Oat Cookies, 3.7 oz.</DD>
<p>These are similar to no-bake cookies where it's soft and chewy, which I love. But unfortunately I'm not a dark chocolate person, plus it had coconut which is definitely a taste I'm not too fond of. If you like dark chocolate and coconut, this is definitely for you!</p>

<DT>Sweet Blueberry Almonds</DT>
<DD>Blueberry flavored almonds, 1 oz.<DD>
<p>I loved this. It was sweet and almondy good, with the added bonus of blueberry flavor. Great snack for when you want something sweet and fulfilling.</p>

<DL>
<DT>Jalapeno Cashews</a></DT>
<DD>Jalapeno-flavored Cashews, 1 oz.</DD>
<p>I love everything and anything that's spicy, so I was happy to find this in my box. They're not spicy at all though, just a little kick with jalapeno flavoring and it pairs so well with the cashews. Another favorite from the trial box and will definitely be ordering more for next month!</p>

<DL>
<DT>Masa Crisps</DT>
<DD>Corn chips with Flax seeds, 1 oz.</DD>
<p>At first I wasn't too excited about this one, but as soon as I had my first bite, I couldn't stop and finished everything in one sitting. It was so crispy salty good! Great to satisfy my salty cravings and an alternative to chips. And since they're in bite size pieces, they might be good as a topping on your salad, I will have to try that soon!</p>

<DL>
<DT>Cranberry Medley</DT>
<DD>Pomegranate and Acai flavored dried Cranberries with Blueberries, 1 oz.</DD>
<p>These are sweet and tart, and although I'm okay with those two flavors together, they were the least favorite from my box. My husband loved them though so at least I'm happy one of us enjoyed it.</p>

<p><b>My Thoughts:</b> This was a great trial box and an even greater introduction to their snacks. We snack a lot in our house and having ones that are healthy is important, so I'll be keeping this subscription because of the quality, selection and convenience it offers. I also like that you can choose which snacks to get as well as skip any month you need to. I've already made my selections for next month, so stay tuned for my next <a href="https://naturebox.com">Nature Box</a> review!</p>
