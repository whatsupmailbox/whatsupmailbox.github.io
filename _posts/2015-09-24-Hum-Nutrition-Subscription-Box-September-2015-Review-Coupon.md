<p>I recently discovered this beauty nutrition supplement and based on its benefits I knew I just had to try them out. HUM was created from the need and experience of the founder's personal struggle with his skin and breakouts. As an adult, I still tend to get breakouts now and then which is irritating and an inconvenience not to mention somewhat embarassing to have so I can relate. Remember the old saying "What you eat is what you are", well that sounds true and there is a link between nutrition and your skin. HUM realizes this and with the help of leaders in the field of nutrition, they've created a line of nutritional products to help you achieve beautiful skin from the inside.</p>

<p>When you first sign up with them, there's a 12-question survey you take so that their nutritionist can suggest the correct and best product for your needs. It's very short and the questions are along the lines of what your weekly diet is, how you feel everyday, and what beauty concerns you have. After you've answered them all, they'll recommend what products are right for you.</p>

<p>HUM has been featured in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Glamour and Marie Claire magazine to name a few, and it's also the secret to many celebrities in achieving a runway/red carpet ready skin. So it's reputable and helped in my decision to try them out.</p>

<p>Now let's move on and see what I chose:</p>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT>Daily Cleanse</DT>
<DD>60 capsules, $25</DD>
</DL>

<p>This vitamin helps clear your skin & body from toxins. It's full of herb-nutrient ingredients that includes algae, which studies link to detoxing the liver, and kelp, recognized for antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<p>After reading it's ingredients and benefits, I knew I had to have this. My love for wine and socializing which includes a cocktail here and there can do a number on my body, liver and kidney to be exact. So hopefully with Daily Cleanse in hand, my body can detoxify naturally, and my liver will rejoice and thank me in the future.</p>

<br>

<DL>
<DT>Flatter Me</DT>
<DD>60 capsules, $25</DD>
</DL>

<p>This has digestive enzyme blends that will help indigestion and reduce its related issues including bloating and fullness. I get bloated sometimes from having too much sodium in my diet and I hate that feeling. The digestive enzyme and herbal blen is also designed to optimize protein, carb, fiber and fats breakdown and to help with nutrient absorption. This will surely help me achieve a flatter stomach and better digestion.</p>

</a></center>

<DL>
<DT>Big Chill</DT>
<DD>30 capsules, $15</DD>
</DL>

<p>Big Chill helps you keep calm, focus and cope with stress. I need this, badly. I may or may not have ADOG, Attention Deficit Oooh Glitter, so it's hard for me to focus as you can see. I focus well on things that are on task, but easily get distracted by other important things that comes unexpectedly. And on top of that, I'm horrible at keeping calm. I tend to overthink, overreact and over everything. I'm an over the top kinda gal. Not everytime, I know the limits, but a lot of times I find myself thinking back and saying "now if only I was calmer in handling this situation", so needless to say, I need Big Chill for all the benefits it offers, stat!</p>

<DL>
<DT>Red Carpet</DT>
<DD>60 capsules, $25</DD>
</DL>

<p>This will help you achieve glowing skin & shiny fuller hair in 6 weeks. Uhh yeah, yes please! It didn't take much for me to put this into the shopping cart, especially after reading the ingredients and benefits below.</p>

<p>From the HUM website:</p>
<p>"Our vegetarian Red Carpet formula includes the perfect balance of GLA, ALA, and Vitamin E— naturally sourced and potently formulated. Made from bio-available nutrients in Black Currant and Sunflower Seeds, Red Carpet’s healthy essential fats support glamorous hair and glowing skin.
