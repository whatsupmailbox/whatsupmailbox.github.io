Ipsy always ships their glam bags in bright neon pink padded envelopes. It stands out in your mailbox and you can't miss when it actually arives!

<br>

Ipsy is very similar to <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Birchbox</a> where all subscribers receive different variations in their bag, and is mostly dependent on the answers you give in the Ipsy beauty quiz. They try to give you products that match your needs and concerns so not everyone will get the same items. And you can retake the beauty quiz at anytime if you feel that the products didn't really match you.

This review is for my profile so it's just one of the many variations that they sent out.

First peek at unboxing shows the gorgeous glam bag!

Every package includes an info card with the theme of the month. This month's theme is "Sugar Highness".

The back side of the card has a note from them and a link where you can learn how to use your Glam Bag goodies.

<H4>The Glam Bag:</H4>

This month's glam bag is an exclusive design that's illustrated by the one and only Michelle Phan herself! I love love love it, it's so manga pretty (manga is a japanese style comic) which I'm obsessed with. I grew up reading and collecting manga so this is right up my alley!

<br>

The inside is baby pink in color and has a plastic material lining so it's liquid friendly.

<H4>Items in Detail:</H4>

[![Trust Fund Beauty Liquid Lipstick in K, Bye](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsyAugust2016TrustFundBeautyLiquidLipstickKBye.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?cid=p_share_ref&sid=link&refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

**Trust Fund Beauty** Liquid Lipstick in K, Bye  
Full Size 8 ml., *Value $22*

<br>

I'm a big fan of Trust Fund Beauty. I have so many of their nail polishes, but I've never tried their liquid lipsticks before so I was ecstatic when I found out that I'll be getting this in my glam bag (I did an early sneak peek).

<br>

[![Trust Fund Beauty Liquid Lipstick in K, Bye](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsyAugust2016TrustFundBeautyLiquidLipstickKBye02.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?cid=p_share_ref&sid=link&refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

The brush has a slanted tip which makes lining your lips easy, no need for another lip brush. The color K, Bye is described as a dusty dessert rose, with a hint of brown shade. It looks great on my olive skintone, a dark natural shade that I can wear everyday. Love this!

[![Pacifica SUNDREAMS LOTUS INFUSED BRONZER in Sunkissed](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsyAugust2016PacificaSundreamLotusInfusedBronzerSunkissed.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?cid=p_share_ref&sid=link&refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

**Pacifica** Sundreams Lotus Infused Bronzer in Sunkissed  
Deluxe Sample Size .88 oz/2.5 g., *Value $10*

<br>

Bronzers are my best friend, so I'm always happy when I receive one. Pacifica is a brand that I've got to try more and more thanks to my subscriptions and I love that they are 100% vegan and cruelty-free.

<br>

[![Pacifica SUNDREAMS LOTUS INFUSED BRONZER in Sunkissed](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsyAugust2016PacificaSundreamLotusInfusedBronzerSunkissed02.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?cid=p_share_ref&sid=link&refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

The case is so cute, it has a golden unicorn on it! In case you weren't aware, unicorns are so "in" these days, you see them as erasers, tape dispensers and so much more.

<br>

[![Pacifica SUNDREAMS LOTUS INFUSED BRONZER in Sunkissed](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsyAugust2016PacificaSundreamLotusInfusedBronzerSunkissed03.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?cid=p_share_ref&sid=link&refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

Sunkissed is a universal color that should flatter most skin tones. It looked pretty natural on me and you can of course layer it on for more color and glow.

[![NYX Born To Glow Liquid Illuminator in Sunbeam](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsyAugust2016NYXBornToGlowLiquidIlluminatorSunbeam.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?cid=p_share_ref&sid=link&refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

**NYX** Born To Glow Liquid Illuminator in Sunbeam  
Deluxe Sample Size 0.5 fl. oz./13 ml., *Value $5.50*

*Note: Subscribers will receive this highlighter in Gleam or Sunbeam.*

<br>

Sunbeam is a soft pink shade that has shimmer and will give you a pop of glow. Second to bronzers, highlighters are my ultimate go to for contouring. I typically like non liquid ones though, but I'm always up for trying new things so I'll be putting this to the test to see if it stands up to my other highlighters that I love.

<br>

[![Dermelect Nail Polish in Unscripted](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsyAugust2016DermelectNailPolishUnscripted.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?cid=p_share_ref&sid=link&refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

**Dermelect** Nail Polish in Unscripted
Full Size 11 ml., *Value $14*

<br>

I love it when I receive nail polishes in my Ipsy glam bags! I've received a Dermelect color in the past that was more on the nude side, so I'm happy to get a different color and what better one to receive in an Ipsy bag than a bold pinkish color!

<br>

Here's the swatch on me:

<br>

[![Dermelect Nail Polish in Unscripted](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsyAugust2016DermelectNailPolishUnscriptedSwatch.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?cid=p_share_ref&sid=link&refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

On their website, Unscripted is described as an "Energetic Violet" color. For some reason it looks more pink on my skintone but hey, I might be wrong. Either way, I love it and I'm so happy I got this in my glam bag!

<br>

[![Symphony Beauty Makeup Cleansing Wipes](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/IpsyAugust2016SymphonyBeautyMakeupCleansingWipes.jpg)](https://www.ipsy.com/new?cid=p_share_ref&sid=link&refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"}

**Symphony Beauty** Makeup Cleansing Wipes in Cucumber & Aloe Vera  
Pack of 10 wipes, Value $1.67

<br>

I don't normally use cleansing wipes on a daily basis, but I do use them when I travel or when I need to wipe off my lipstick while I'm out and about. So these will surely be used at some point.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This month was a great glam bag for me! I'm so happy I received both a nail polish and a Trust Fund Beauty product, so so happy. And the other items were great and totally will be used too, so that's a major win for me. For all you current subscribers out there that may have received items that were not a complete match, make sure you update your beauty profile now and then, it totally helps at least in my experience. And for you non-subscribers, I just have to say that [Ipsy](https://www.ipsy.com/new?cid=p_share_ref&sid=link&refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"} is one of my must have subscription that I can't see myself without. For the $10 price that you pay, you certainly receive way more, and they always seem to send more than 1 full size product everytime, that's big for the price you pay. Plus you get a cute makeup bag to boot! If you're new to subscriptions, this is definitely one to start with and one to have.

Interested in subscribing? You can go to [www.ipsy.com](https://www.ipsy.com/new?cid=p_share_ref&sid=link&refer=uns8d){:target="_blank"} to join and start receiving your own monthly glam bags!
