<p><b>Subscription:</b> <a href="https://www.beautydna.com/" target="_blank">Beauty DNA</a></p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $25/monthly</p>
<p><b>Shipping:</b> Free. </p>
<p><b>What's in the box:</b> One FULL SIZED beauty product that's matched to your "Beauty Profile" that you complete upon signing up.</p>
<br>

<p>This is my first box from Beauty DNA so I was super excited when I finally got it in the mail!</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>I purchased a deal from <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Ruelala</a> (it's no longer available) a couple of months back but only got around to redeeming it this month. Checkout my blog frequently as I post deals on subscription boxes whenever they're available =)</p>

<p>Beauty DNA is a completely different experience than other beauty subscriptions since everyone gets a different full-sized product that's matched with their skin concerns or needs. When you join, there's a "Beauty Profile" that you complete and below are just a couple of examples of the questions:</p>

<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNASep2015Profile.png'></center></p>
<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNASep2015Profile2.png'></center></p>

<p>These are 2 out of 14 pages that you'll need to complete and although that might seem like a lot, think of it as a consultation with your doctor - the more you let them know about you, the more they can help you out. It didn't take me long at all to complete it and I also like the fact that you can access your Beauty Profile anytime and modify it if you ever have any changes in your skincare needs.</p>

<H4>Based on my Beauty Profile, here is the item they matched me with:</H4>

<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNASep2015Lash.jpg'></center></p>
<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNASep2015Lash2.jpg'></center></p>

<DL>
<DT>Hydroxitone Lash</a></DT>
<DD>Full Size 150 ml net 5.0 fl. oz, Value $50</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've tried this brand before but was not aware that they had treatments for lashes too. I"ve used Latisse before with good results so I'm curious to see how this compares.</p>

<p>Application was similar to Latisse in which you apply it on like an eyeliner.<p>
<br>

<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNASep2015Info.jpg'></center></p>
<p>Beauty DNA also included a detailed Beauty Report about the product and why they matched it for you.</p>
<br>

<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNASep2015Info2.jpg'></center></p>
<p>It also includes the value of the product.</p>

<p>I love this Beauty Report, it feels so personalized and informational too!</p>
<br>

<H2><i class="icon-gift"></i> Bonus Item:</H2>

<p>Because I purchased this Beauty DNA subscription through <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Ruelala</a>, the deal also included one extra product with every box. So here's my extra product:</p>

<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNASep2015Hair.jpg'></center></p>

<DL>
<DT>Hair treatment</a></DT>
<DD>Full Size 3.5 fl oz / 105 ml, Value $35</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've never heard of this brand before. I do like what I've found out so far though. It's a leave-in conditioner that can be used on damp or dry hair!</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> I'm in love with Beauty DNA! They did a great job at matching me with a product that I need and the value is totally there, especially with the extra item too! And if I had to be completely honest, I actually love the bonus item more than the matched item which makes this box an absolute slam dunk for me. If you're tired of sample sizes, try Beauty DNA and find new products that will work for you. I can't wait to see what they'll match me with next month!</p>
