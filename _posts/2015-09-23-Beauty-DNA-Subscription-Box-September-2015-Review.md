<p>Oooh, an Eye Report is my match for this month, I wonder what it is?!</p>
<br>

<p>I purchased a deal from <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Ruelala</a> (it's no longer available) a couple of months back and this is my second shipment from that deal. Checkout my blog frequently as I post deals on subscription boxes whenever they're available =)</p>

<p>Beauty DNA is a completely different experience than other beauty subscriptions since everyone gets a different full-sized product that's matched with their skin concerns or needs. When you join, there's a "Beauty Profile" that you complete and below are just a couple of examples of the questions:</p>

<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNASep2015Profile.png'></center></p>
<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNASep2015Profile2.png'></center></p>

<p>These are 2 out of 14 pages that you'll need to complete and although that might seem like a lot, think of it as a consultation with your doctor - the more you let them know about you, the more they can help you out. It didn't take me long at all to complete it and I also like the fact that you can access your Beauty Profile anytime and modify it if you ever have any changes in your skincare needs.</p>

<H4>Based on my Beauty Profile, here is the item they matched me with:</H4>

<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNASep2015Lash.jpg'></center></p>

<DL>
<DT>Hydroxatone Lashatone</a></DT>
<DD>Full Size 1 ml, Value $50</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've tried this brand before but was not aware that they had treatments for lashes too. I've used Latisse before with good results so I'm curious to see how this compares.</p>

<p>Application was similar to Latisse in which you apply it on like an eyeliner.<p>
<br>

<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNASep2015Info.jpg'></center></p>
<p>Beauty DNA also included a detailed Beauty Report about the product and why they matched it for you. I love this Beauty Report, it feels so personalized and informational too!</p>
<br>

<H2><i class="icon-gift"></i> Bonus Item:</H2>

<p>Because I purchased this Beauty DNA subscription through <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/invite/whatsupmailbox" target="_blank">Ruelala</a>, the deal also included one extra product with every box. So here's my bonus product:</p>

<p><center><img src='/images/BeautyDNASep2015Hair.jpg'></center></p>

<DL>
<DT>Keratherapy - Keratin Infused Rapid Rescue</a></DT>
<DD>Full Size 125ml, Value $24</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've never heard of this brand before. It's a finishing product that's supposed to transform dull, dry hair to shiny, smooth and healthy. I like that it can be used on both damp or dry hair. I used it this morning after towel drying my hair and just let it air dry after. The scent is quite pleasant, sweet and refreshing. So for the results, I did notice smoother and shinier hair which is great for my frizzy and dry ends. Great product!</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Another great match from Beauty DNA! Both items have been used and fits my needs as my profile suggested. The value is totally there, especially with the extra item too! If you're tired of sample sizes, try Beauty DNA and find new products that will work for you. I can't wait to see what they'll match me with next month!</p>
