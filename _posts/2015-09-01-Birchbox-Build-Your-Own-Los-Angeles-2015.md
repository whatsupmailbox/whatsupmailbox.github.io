<p>I was so excited when Birchbox announced that they'll be coming to Los Angeles, I knew I just had to go! The event was from Friday-Sunday so I decided to go on Friday since most people will probably still be at work that day so there's less crowd compared to the weekend.</p>

<p>For the LA event, Men got free hair trimmings while Women got free manicures!</p>

<center><img src='/images/BirchboxEventLA2015S.jpg'></center>
<p>You also got Free Sprinkles ice cream with any purchase! A perfect freebie for a hot and sunny Los Angeles day!</p>

<p>The event started at 12noon and I got there around 12.30 and there was already a line. It wasn't too long, but it did move pretty slow. Plus the heat that day was extra caliente, we got hot and sweaty in no time!</p>

<center><img src='/images/BirchboxEventLA2015G.jpg'></center>
<p>There was absolutely no line for Birchbox Man, so I went to that one first while my girlfriend stood in line for the women's one. As expected, you get to choose 1 Lifestyle item, 1 Skincare, 1 Grooming, 1 Hair product and 1 Fragrance.</p>

<p>Here's my Birchbox Man selections:</p>
<center><img src='/images/BirchboxEventLA2015G.jpg'></center>
<p>Although I chose the earphones for my September box already, I decided to get another one this time around since the choices were either these earphones, the Coola packable backpack, or a plain grey shirt. I also have the backpack already, but I think I'd rather have 2 earphones instead especially since the value is the highest amongst all 3 ;)</p>

<p>After building my own Birchbox Man, you go to the cashier area to pay and when I was there they told me that the first 100 people to purchase today will be getting another FREE box! And since I got the Birchbox Man, they let me choose either the Men's box or Women's box as my free one. I chose the Men's, no brainer there for me =P</p>

<p>Here's my FREE Birchbox Man:<p>
<center><img src='/images/BirchboxEventLA2015M.jpg'></center>
<p>The free boxes were chosen randomly so you didn't know what you get until you open it up. Turns out I got the January 2015 box which included ANOTHER earphones, lol!<p>

<p>Back to my timeline, after purchasing the men's box, I went back in line to join my girlfriend and it wasn't long before we were in front to build our own Birchbox, yay!</p>

<p>What a cute box! I love the details of how deep the pool is and the "Dive In" sign too.</p>

<br>

<p>I got 6 items this month (one of them is a bonus sample packet) and that dry shampoo totally got my attention!</p>
<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

<p><center><img src='/images/BirchboxAugust2015Coola.jpg'></center></p>

<DL>
<DT><a href="http://www.coolasuncare.com/Radical-Recovery-After-Sun-Lotion?keyword=radical&category_id=0" target="_blank">Coola - Environmental Repaid Plus Radical Recovery After Sun Lotion</a></DT>
<DD>Deluxe sample size .5 fl. oz/15ml, Value $2.50</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love Coola and have quite a bit of their products already, but I don't have this after-sun lotion so I'm happy to try this out. I also love the fact that this lotion is made of 99% natural ingredients and 70% of it is organic, a plus in my book.</p>
<p>I recently returned from a tropical vacation and got somewhat sunburned so I tried this on some areas on my skin that is peeling off now. I find that it moisturizes the area really well, has a slight fresh scent plus a cooling effect to calm the skin down. One of the ingredients is organic Agave which provides hydration and promotes collagen synthesis while offering UV boosting protection and clinically proven relief from sunburn.</p>
<p>This is such a great product, I see it working on my sunburned skin and I will definitely be purchasing the full version.</p>
<br>

<p><center><img src='/images/BirchboxAugust2015Cleanser.jpg'></center></p>
<DL>
<DT><a href="http://www.drbrandtskincare.com/product/pores-no-more-cleanser-nettoyant.do" target="_blank">dr. Brandt - Pores No More Cleanser</a></DT>
<DD>Deluxe sample size 0.25 oz/7.5 ml, Value $2.50</DD>
</DL>

<p>"A non-drying, pore refining cleanser that uses the power of tea tree oil, willow bark and salicylic acid to dissolve impurities and decongest pores, leaving skin with a fresh, ultra-clean sensation."</p>
<p>I've received dr.Brandt's Pores No More products before but not the cleanser so I was excited to try this out. It has some lather and only has a very slight scent which is good for people who are picky about scents like me. My skin felt refreshed and strange as it sounds, it did leave my skin feeling ultra-clean. Since I have oily skin, this cleanser works really well for me and I'm so glad I found this. Thanks Birchbox, another great item!</p>
<br>

<p><center><img src='/images/BirchboxAugust2015Ipkn.jpg'></center></p>
<DL>
<DT><a href="http://ipknus.com/skincare/category/sun-protection/pore-apple-sun-cream.html" target="_blank">IPKN - Pore Apple Sun Cream</a></DT>
<DD>Deluxe sample size 0.24 fl.oz./7 ml, Value $3.50</DD>
</DL>

<p>IPKN is a Korean beauty brand. I've never used this brand or product before, so I'm interested to try this out. The ingredients look okay, not the best but still safe to use. I also discovered that it's oil-free and has a color correcting base that's helpful when applying this under makeup.</p>
<br>

<p><center><img src='/images/BirchboxAugust2015DryShampoo.jpg'></center></p>

<DL>
<DT><a href="http://www.randco.com/sprays-oils/death-valley-dry-shampoo.html" target="_blank">R+Co - Death Valley Dry Shampoo</a></DT>
<DD>Travel spray bottle 75ml, Value $7</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love getting dry shampoos in any box. I use them quite often, and the size they send out are perfect to put in any bag and for travel purposes too.</p>
<p>This dry shampoo has a floral powdery fragrance that's quite feminine. I wouldn't say it's my favorite scent but still good enough that it doesn't bother me. It sprays powerfully and you don't see any white powder at all even immediately after application, love it. Plus this dry shampoo also volumizes which is amazing. So far I'm loving this dry shampoo, much better than Batiste in my opinion.</p>
<br>

<p><center><img src='/images/BirchboxAugust2015Bronzer.jpg'></center></p>
<DL>
<DT><a href="http://www.thebalm.com/balm-desert.html" target="_blank">theBalm Cosmetics - Balm Desert Bronzer/Blush</a></DT>
<DD>Sample size 0.8 g., Value $2.50</DD>
</DL>

<p>I've sampled other products from this brand before and had good experience with them. I was happy to get a bronzer/blush to sample, but man it is quite tiny! I included a quarter so you can see how small it is.</p>
<p><center><img src='/images/BirchboxAugust2015Bronzer2.jpg'></center></p>
<p>Due to the size, I'm not sure how effective I can sample this product out, but so far by using my fingers alone I can see that the colors work with my olive tanned skin and there's not much shimmer to it which I prefer.</p>
<br>

<H4><i class="icon-gift"></i> Bonus item:</H4>

<p><center><img src='/images/BirchboxAugust2015Hair.jpg'></center></p>

<DL>
<DT><a href="http://www.kerastase-usa.com/bain_force_architecte/BFA0000.html?cgid=damaged-cleanse-treat&dwvar_BFA0000_size=250ml#start=1&cgid=damaged-cleanse-treat" target="_blank">KÃ©rastase - Bain Force Architecte</a></DT>
<DD>Sample Packet, Value $1</DD>
</DL>

<p>I love it when I get a bonus item. It means extra product AND extra points for me to review which translates to more money to spend in the Birchbox shop ;)</p>
<p>This shampoo matches my hair's needs as it helps reconstruct brittle damaged hair that has split-ends. I color treat my hair and although lately I haven't been doing it as often as I did before, it still gets a beating from the heat styling, sun and chlorine (from the pool). The only problem is this shampoo has parabens and sulfates in its ingredients, so sadly I won't be able to try this out. What a bummer, I really did want to.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This box was great for me and I found 3 amazing products that I love and will be purchasing, so that in itself was valuable to me. I received 6 items in total this month which means I'll be getting $6 back by reviewing them, so in essence this subscription only cost me $4, what a deal!</p>
