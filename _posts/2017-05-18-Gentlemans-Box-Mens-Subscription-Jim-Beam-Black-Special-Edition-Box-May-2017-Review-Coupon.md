An info magazine is always included with every box and it packs in a lot of useful and stylish info! The first page is the Table of Contents and you can see a summary of what this little booklet offers.

And since this month is a special collaboration with Jim Beam, it wouldn't be complete without a section on the history of the company itself.

<br>

<H4>And here are all the items from the May box:</H4>

<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

[![Southern Scholar Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxMay2017SouthernScholarSocks.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

**Southern Scholar** Socks, *Value $12*

My husband can never have enough socks, especially with all the cool and vibrant styles they have these days, it's too fun to limit yourself to only a few pair!

These socks will be a great addition to his collection. The arrows mixed with polka dots turns out to be a great combo. And the red and white color, well it just screams southern for sure.

<br>

[![Salt + Dapper Neck Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxMay2017SaltDapperNeckTie.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

**Salt + Dapper** Neck Tie, *Value $39*

OMG, I'm in LOVE with this tie! It definitely reminds me of the Burberry check print, and it could very well pass as one ;)

This will look amazing with pretty much any outfit, it's that versatile. Made of 100% cotton, it certainly is great for the casual look, but you can of course dress it up as well. Plus it'll look amazing paired with the socks!

<br>

[![The Dark Knot - Camden Lapel Pin](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxMay2017TheDarkKnotCamdenLapelPin.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

**The Dark Knot** Camden Lapel Pin, *Value $29*

A red flower lapel pin that will complete your southern dapper outfit! 

<br>

[![The Dark Knot - Camden Lapel Pin](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxMay2017TheDarkKnotCamdenLapelPin02.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

The card that came with it had some suggestions on outfit pairing, but I say wear it all red and use the tie and socks that's in the box with this lapel pin and just go all out Southern Red!

[![Woodchuck USA Jim Beam Black Coasters](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxMay2017WoodchuckUSAJimBeamBlackCoasters.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

**Woodchuck USA Jim Beam Black Coasters**, *Value $35*

We're finally on to the products that represent the Jim Beam collaboration! Wood coasters with the Jim Beam Black logo are definitely appropriate and very well appreciated. 

<br>

[![Woodchuck USA Jim Beam Black Coasters](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxMay2017WoodchuckUSAJimBeamBlackCoasters02.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

I love wood coasters because not only are they biodegradable, but they also absorb the moisture or liquid from your cold glass or bottle. That way you're not stuck with a ring of liquid when you lift your glass or bottle up, and it also won't stick to your beverage when cold like some coasters do.

<br>

[![Jim Beam Black Ice Tray](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxMay2017JimBeamBlackIceCubeTray.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

**Jim Beam Black** Ice Cube Tray, *Sponsored*

This exclusive ice cube tray will produce pretty large cubes, more than double the regular ice cube size. It's perfect for sipping bourbon of course, but also whiskey or other hard liquor that needs to be appreciated cold and slowly. I personally like metal cubes instead as they don't melt and dilute the actual beverage, but those can cost a hefty price and I've received them in a much higher luxury subscription box, so this is still a great item to include for the price point of this box, and perfect for this month's theme. 

<br>

[![AJ Murray's Kentucky Bourbon Lotion](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxMay2017AJMurraysKentuckyBourbonLotion.jpg)](http://gentlemansbox.pxf.io/c/164125/331548/5011){:target="_blank"}

**AJ Murray's** Kentucky Bourbon Lotion *Value $4*

AJ Murray's is a family owned business based out of Louisville, Kentucky. The fact that this lotion is named Kentucky Bourbon got me really intrigued and I just had to apply this on right away. The lotion itself is made from organic ingredients and it does feel moisturizing without being too heavy, but I'm not quite certain it smells like bourbon. To me it smells more like a sweet pecan pie, but hey, I'm no expert when it comes to bourbon as it's not really my go-to liquor =D

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** This month's collaboration with Jim Beam Black was so fun! I always love special edition/collab boxes as they bring out a different style than what the actual subscription box would normally do. And being that it's a collab with a liquor brand... well it probably made a lot of gentleman's day out there. We all know how a good glass of adult beverage after a long day's at work can be much needed and well deserved. Now if only they included a mini bottle of the bourbon in this box, wouldn't that be nice! As always, Gentleman's Box delivered on the value and products, and it certainly was a great special edition box. I hope they make these collabs more often as it's such a treat!
