First look at unboxing you see a big cardstock sign with a French statement. This month is the classic yet very much used "Bonjour" phrase, which means Good Morning or Hello. They send one with every box and I collect them all to frame. It's a simple yet chic way to decorate any wall.

You finally see the items inside wrapped with a pretty ribbon. This month's ribbon color is blue!

Oui Please always includes a catalog magazine listing all the items that were included for the current Volume box. I think it's great and so informational, plus they're made with such good quality, I collect all of them to browse around when I have French withdrawals.

Here's a look inside the booklet:

**Maison Lejaby** Top, *Value $85*

When I saw that I got a lingerie in my box, I was literally jumping up and down in pure bliss. This is amazing and such quality too. It's so soft thanks to the Lycra material and it bedazzled ever so softly with blue swarovski crystals.

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016MaisonLejabyCrystalCollectionLingerieTop2.jpg)

Here you can see the crystals more clearly. I love how subtle yet bedazzling the crystals are, they add a touch of glamour to this classy lingerie top!

<br>

The branding is located on the upper left side, where your left arm would rest.

**Maison Lejaby** Tanga Panty, *Value $65*

I love laces, something about them just makes you feel and look sexy. Needless to say, I am beyond happy to receive this matching lingerie panty. I tried both the top and bottom right away, and boy will my husband get a surprise tonight =P

This matching bottom is made of the same Lycra material in a bikini panty style. It's also bedazzled with blue swarovski crystals just like the matching top, but for the panty, the crystals are located on the sides.

<br>

Here's a look from the backside:

The lace is actually on the backside of this panty and it will surely make your bottom look extra sexy ;)

And on top of that, it also has the blue swarovski crystals!
