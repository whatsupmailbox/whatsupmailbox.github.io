[OuiPlease](https://ouipleasebox.com){:target="_blank"} safely packs their precious boxes inside a bigger black packaging box. They are also shipped through UPS Ground so if you're registered with My UPS, you'll get notification as soon as it's shipped and tracking details too.

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016OpenPackage.jpg)

When you open the package, you see the actual box inside and it's safely covered with bubble wrap to ensure it gets to you in perfect condition.

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016Box.jpg)

Et voila, the infamous OuiPlease box! I love love love these boxes, they're so strong and sturdy, I use them as keepsake boxes for tons of stuff! From jewelry, to beauty products and so much more. Best reusable box out there amongst all the other subscription boxes!

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016OpenBox.jpg)

What better way to open my [OuiPlease](https://ouipleasebox.com){:target="_blank"} box than with my Eiffel Tower gold scissors ;)

First look at unboxing you see a big cardstock sign with a French statement. This month is the classic yet very much used "Bonjour" phrase, which means Good Morning or Hello. They send one with every box and I collect them all to frame. It's a simple yet chic way to decorate any wall.

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016OpenBox2.jpg)

You finally see the items inside wrapped with a pretty ribbon. This month's ribbon color is blue!

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016Info.jpg)

Oui Please always includes a catalog magazine listing all the items that were included for the current Volume box. I think it's great and so informational, plus they're made with such good quality, I collect all of them to browse around when I have French withdrawals.

<br>

Here's a look inside the booklet:

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016MaisonLejabyCrystalCollectionLingerieTop.jpg)

**Maison Lejaby** Top, *Value $85*

When I saw that I got a lingerie in my box, I was literally jumping up and down in pure bliss. This is amazing and such quality too. It's so soft thanks to the Lycra material and it's also bedazzled ever so softly with blue Swarovski crystals.

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016MaisonLejabyCrystalCollectionLingerieTop4.jpg)

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016MaisonLejabyCrystalCollectionLingerieTop2.jpg)

Here you can see the crystals more clearly. I love how subtle yet bedazzling the crystals are, they add a touch of glamour to this classy lingerie top!

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016MaisonLejabyCrystalCollectionLingerieTop3.jpg)

The branding is located on the upper left side, where your left arm would rest.

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016MaisonLejabyCrystalCollectionLingerieTanga.jpg)

**Maison Lejaby** Tanga Panty, *Value $65*

Oh la la, this panty is just gorge! I love laces, something about them just makes you feel and look sexy. Needless to say, I am beyond happy to receive this matching lingerie panty. I tried both the top and bottom right away, and boy will my husband get a surprise tonight =P

This matching bottom is made of the same Lycra material in a bikini panty style. It's also bedazzled with blue Swarovski crystals just like the matching top, but for the panty, the crystals are located on the sides.

<br>

Here's a look from the backside:

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016MaisonLejabyCrystalCollectionLingerieTanga2.jpg)

The lace is actually on the backside of this panty and it will surely make your bottom look extra sexy ;)

And on top of that, it also has the blue Swarovski crystals! Aaaaahhhh, I'm so so happy I got this!

<br>


![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016SenchaAndBourbonBeachCoverStole.jpg)

**Sencha & Bourbon** Beach Cover Stole with your personal initials, *Value $130*


[OuiPlease](https://ouipleasebox.com){:target="_blank"} revealed this item last month that every subscriber will be receiving this item in their box. What a great item to include AND it's also personalized with your own initials! How amazing is that!

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016SenchaAndBourbonBeachCoverStole2.jpg)

The colors are so pretty and it's totally my style. So glad I got this color combo! Plus it's super soft and feels uber luxurious. 

You can wear this as a scarf, a beach cover up or a glamorous stole for the chilly evenings. Made from silk and personalized with your initials, this has got to be one of the most unique items I've ever received in a subscription box. Bravo [OuiPlease](https://ouipleasebox.com){:target="_blank"}!

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016SenchaAndBourbonBeachCoverStole3.jpg)

The brand tag is also really unique, so unique that I just had to feature it in my review.

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016SenchaAndBourbonBeachCoverStole4.jpg)

First off, the background story of this brand as well as the materials used is explained.

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016SenchaAndBourbonBeachCoverStole5.jpg)

Then in the middle section, it explains how the tags are made of seed paper so instead of throwing it away as you would normally with other tags, you can plant it instead. How cool is that!

Not only do they make amazing products, I love how eco-friendly they are with their packaging as well. Love it!

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016LesInterchangeablesFineRockBraceletBlue2.jpg)

**Les Interchangeables** Fine Rock Bracelet in Blue, *Value $45*

One of my favorite things to receive in my [OuiPlease](https://ouipleasebox.com){:target="_blank"} boxes are their jewelry items. I get to discover new and amazing jewelry brands from France that I would never have known otherwise.

This bracelet is stretchable as well as adjustable. It also incorporates Swarovski crystals. Yay, more dazzle!

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016LesInterchangeablesFineRockBraceletBlue4.jpg)

<br>

Here's a look at the bracelet on me:

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016LesInterchangeablesFineRockBraceletBlue3.jpg)

I love how I can wear this bracelet either casually during the day, or pair this to add some sparkle to my evening attire. Plus did I mention it's adjustable? Music to my small petite wrists!

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016DavidJourquinFragranceCuirMandarineCuirSolaire.jpg)

**David Jourquin** Fragrance in Cuir Mandarine and Cuir Solaire, *Value $30 ($15/each)*

Subscribers who receive these will get 2 fragrances in either Cuir Solaire, Cuir Mandarine, Cuir Tabac, Cuir Caraibes, Cuir de R'Eve, or Cuir Altesse.

Such cute packaging! These drawstring bags are made of leather like material. Definitely reusable and I love the bright colors too. Inside are the sample spray vials in 5ml sizes each.

Cuir Mandarine has top notes of blended Lavender, middle notes of Leather, Mandarin, Black Pepper, and Light Tobacco Leaf, and base notes of Patchouli.

Cuir Solaire has top notes of Orange and Bergamot, middle notes of Jasmine, Clove and Sea Notes, and base notes of Labdanum, Amber, Patchouli, Leather and Vanilla.

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016HaremDesSensLusciousShowerCream.jpg)

**Harem Des Sens** Luscious Shower Cream, *Value $25*

I received their body lotion in my [Vol. 1.6 box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/coupons/Oui-Please-Volume-1-6-Subscription-Box-Review-Coupon/){:target="_blank"} last February and loved it. So I'm happy I get to try out their shower gel.

"Almond and argan powder exfoliant gently polishes your skin, leaving you silky smooth and wrapped up in a warm, amber scent."

Can't wait to try this in the shower tonight!

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016MaisonBoissierChocolatePetals.jpg)

**Maison Boissier** Fruit Chocolate Petals, *Value $20*

On their website, these chocolates actually go for €34, so they actually cost more than what [OuiPlease](https://ouipleasebox.com){:target="_blank"} states!

Chocolates, yum! And such pretty ones too! Leave it to the French to make their epicures look equally gorgeous as they are delicious.

<br>

Here's a closer look at the chocolates:

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016MaisonBoissierChocolatePetals2.jpg)

Aren't they pretty?! The white chocolate petals are flavored with Strawberry, Mandarin, Lemon and Green tea. Then there's also dark chocolate and milk chocolate petals.

This will look great displayed for an afternoon tea party with my gals. Oooh, can't wait!

<br>

![Oui Please Vol. 2.2 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/OuiPleaseVol22June2016CousuDeFilBlancSoapBar.jpg)

**Cousu de Fil Blanc** Mountain Milk Soap Bar, *Value $10*

"Cousu de Fil Blanc soaps are handmade in France by a master soapmaker using traditional techniques. Soaps are made with high quality natural ingredients including vegetable oils, clays, honey, and essential oils."

I received the Mountain Milk soap which has sweet almond oil and mountain honey in its ingredients. They describe the scent to be mountain pastures, and I find it to be a very earthy and fresh scent.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** I am consistently impressed with [OuiPlease](https://ouipleasebox.com){:target="_blank"} box after box. Such great curation and amazing items, I am loving every single one of them! I may have a penchant for French and luxurious items, and this subscription certainly delivers that. I'm still in happy mode from receiving a set of lingerie and a personalized silk scarf, so so happy! Not only were the items things that I will totally use, but I also discovered new brands that I've fallen in love with and will certainly be buying more of. Plus with a total value of $410, that's almost triple the cost of the box! Ahhh, can't rave enough about this box!

If you haven't subscribed yet, you can [subscribe here] (https://ouipleasebox.com){:target="_blank"} and use coupon code **OUIWHATSUP** to get 20% off any subscription. That brings the cost down to $120 for one box or $520 for a whole year! That's a très good deal! 

*FYI, Vol. 2.2 box is still available so if you subscribe now, you'll be getting this box. Just remember that variations exist for this subscription so you may not be getting the same items as me, but the personalized scarf will for sure be included.*
