So I've been taking a break from [Glossybox](https://gbx.to/r/USCI=MTMzODY3){:target="_blank"} since the beginning of this year because I just had way too many makeup and skincare. After taking a bit of hiatus, I decided to come back for their special collaboration with Broadway's Tony Awards box to see what curation they'd come up with. So here it is!

<br>

[![Glossybox June 2016 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJune2016TonyAwardsBox.jpg)](https://gbx.to/r/USCI=MTMzODY3){:target="_blank"}

Glossybox always comes up with specially designed boxes for their collaborations. This box represents the Tony Awards well with the red carpet color and symbols that you may find displayed on their screens.

As always, the packaging inside is finished with a bowtie and their info card. 

<br>

The Info Card:

<H4>And here are my Ipsy June 2016 items:</H4>

<H4>Items in Detail:</H4>

[![LA Splash Diamond Lipgloss](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJune2016TonyAwardsLASplashDiamondLipgloss.jpg)](https://gbx.to/r/USCI=MTMzODY3){:target="_blank"}

**LA Splash** Diamond Lipgloss in Red Carpet, *Value $18*

I do love lipglosses but lately I've been more into matte ones and although the Red Carpet color seems okay, the ingredients certainly is not. It has parabens which is a big no no for me. And on top of that, this brand seems like a drugstore brand to me, so I will definitely be passing this along.

<br>

[![Icona Milano Emotion Allowed Mascara](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJune2016TonyAwardsIconaMilanoEmotionAllowedMascara.jpg)](https://gbx.to/r/USCI=MTMzODY3){:target="_blank"}

**Icona Milano** Emotion Allowed Mascara. *Value $19*

Haha, I just love how they named it "Emotion Allowed" mascara. It's waterproof so you're allowed to show your emotions and cry if you want to, at least that's what they're marketing this to be.

<br>

[![Icona Milano Emotion Allowed Mascara](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJune2016TonyAwardsIconaMilanoEmotionAllowedMascara2.jpg)](https://gbx.to/r/USCI=MTMzODY3){:target="_blank"}

The brush is a rounded shape and the bristles are short. I'm not sure this will be good for my sparse and short lashes, plus it doesn't say that this will lengthen or volumize your lashes so I may or may not try this.

<br>

[![Sebastian Professional Shaper Fierce Finishing Hairspray](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJune2016TonyAwardsSebastianProfessionalShaperFierceHairspray.jpg)](https://gbx.to/r/USCI=MTMzODY3){:target="_blank"}

**Sebastian Professional** Shaper Fierce Finishing Hairspray. *Value $3 (estimated)*

I've never tried this brand before and to be honest, I rarely use hairspray in my daily routine, but I do use it for special events. It does say ultra-firm finishing hairspray though which sounds like there would be a lot of hold and probably no movement in hair. I like more of a natural look hairspray so I will have to pass this along.

<br>

[![Sebastian Professional Dark Oil](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJune2016TonyAwardsSebastianProfessionalDarkOil.jpg)](https://gbx.to/r/USCI=MTMzODY3){:target="_blank"}

**Sebastian Professional** Dark Oil. **Bonus Item*

This came along as an extra to accompany the included hairspray. These type of oils are great for hair that feels extra dry or frizzy. They also suggest mixing this dark oil with a moisturizing conditioner and leave it on like a hair mask for 5-10 minutes. I will definitely have to try that.

<br>

[![SinfulColors Kylie Jenner Trend Matters Nail Polish](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJune2016TonyAwardsSinfulColorsKylieJennerTrendMattersNailPolish.jpg)](https://gbx.to/r/USCI=MTMzODY3){:target="_blank"}

**SinfulColors** Kylie Jenner Trend Matters Nail Polish in Kitty Pink. *Value $3*

I do love receiving nail polishes in my sub boxes, but not one that's a drugstore brand. The color is a nice everyday pastel pink color so I may still be using this, just kind of disappointed that they went with this brand.

<br>

[![Caolion Hot Cool Pore Pack Duo](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJune2016TonyAwardsCaolionHotCoolPorePackDuo.jpg)](https://gbx.to/r/USCI=MTMzODY3){:target="_blank"}

**Caolion** Hot Cool Pore Pack Duo. *Value $10 (estimated)*

With all the K-Beauty rage going on lately, I can see why they may have included this in the box. It did get good reviews on Sephora so I may just have to try this out.

[![Caolion Hot Cool Pore Pack Duo](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJune2016TonyAwardsCaolionHotCoolPorePackDuo2.jpg)](https://gbx.to/r/USCI=MTMzODY3){:target="_blank"}

The packaging is a single-use pack, which is both convenient and travel friendly. Hopefully I'll see some results with just one use.

<br>

[![Tan Towel Self-Tan Towelette](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJune2016TonyAwardsTanTowel.jpg)](https://gbx.to/r/USCI=MTMzODY3){:target="_blank"}

**Tan Towel** Self-Tan Towelette. *Value $8 (estimated)*

The towelettes in these sample packs are smaller than their regular sized ones, 7.1 by 9 inches, so you may need to stick to areas that are not that large if you'll be using this. They state that you'll see results within 2 to 4 hours of application, and you can get a deeper tan if needed with continued applications. Since I'm naturally tan, I will be passing this along.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** Honestly, this was one of my least favorite boxes from them. It's supposed to be a collaboration box with Broadway's Tony Awards, which should mean glamour and luxury or prestige, but nothing in this box represented that at all. How disappointing. The only thing that comes close is the actual box, and that's kind of sad to say. I'll probably be using 2 out of the 7 items in this box, and those 2 items certainly cost less than the subscription price. So sad and such a bummer, was really hoping that they would do great with this curation. Oh well, it's back to unsubscribing again until they come up with a spoiler that will peek my interest.
