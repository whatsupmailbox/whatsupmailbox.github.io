Glossybox is one of those subscription boxes that sends out beauty products such as skincare and makeup. It's different than some beauty subscriptions out there in that the sizes include full sizes - not all, but quite a few.

<br>

[![First look at unboxing](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJuly2016OpenPackage.jpg)](http://glossybox.evyy.net/c/164125/266055/4265){:target="_blank"}

First look at unboxing shows the actual Glossybox inside, a pretty pastel pink box that is totally reusable.

<br>

[![Glossybox July 2016 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJuly2016Box.jpg)](http://glossybox.evyy.net/c/164125/266055/4265){:target="_blank"}

I have a lot of these boxes by now and I use them to keep pretty little things inside.

<br>

Inside you'll find your items nicely packaged and wrapped with tissue paper then finished off with a black ribbon. You also see the info card that they always include with every box.

<br>

The Info Card:

<br>

<H4>Items in Detail:</H4>

[![Fango Essenziali Moisturize Mask](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJuly2016FangoEssenzialiMoisturizeMask.jpg)](http://glossybox.evyy.net/c/164125/266055/4265){:target="_blank"}

**Fango Essenziali** Moisturize Treatment Sheet Mask, 1 sheet. *Value $7*

This mask will help to deeply moisturize dry skin. It has Avocado, Kelp and Acai berry to name a few of its ingredients. I think I'll be saving this for Winter when my skin actually gets pretty parched.

<br>

[![SINFULSHINE Top Coat](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJuly2016SinfulColorsTopCoat.jpg)](http://glossybox.evyy.net/c/164125/266055/4265){:target="_blank"}

**SINFULCOLORS** Top Coat, Full Size. *Value $3*

Subscribers received either a color polish or this top coat and I'm super happy that I got the top coat. I was actually in need of one so this couldn't have come at a better time.

<br>

[![Leighton Denny Miracle Mist Speed Drying Spray for Nail Polish](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJuly2016LeightonDennyMiracleMistSpeedDryingSprayNailPolish.jpg)](http://glossybox.evyy.net/c/164125/266055/4265){:target="_blank"}

**Leighton Denny** Miracle Mist Speed Drying Spray for Nail Polish, Full Size. *Value $16*

This spray will speed up your manicure drying process and keep your newly colored nails smudge-free for days. I've always just used fast-drying top coats so I'm excited to try this out.

<br>

[![Eyeko Fat Eye Stick](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJuly2016EyekoFatEyeStick.jpg)](http://glossybox.evyy.net/c/164125/266055/4265){:target="_blank"}

**Eyeko** Fat Eye Stick, Full Size. *Value $12*

I have quite a few eyeliners from Eyeko thanks to other subs and they work pretty well. I don't have this eye stick though so it'll be great to try. There's no color stated on the stick, but it's a dark bronze color that has shimmer. You can wear it lightly during the day and layer it on more intense for the night.

<br>

[![Glov Quick Treat Makeup Remover](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJuly2016GlovQuickTreat.jpg)](http://glossybox.evyy.net/c/164125/266055/4265){:target="_blank"}

**Glov** Quick Treat Makeup Remover, Full Size. *Value $5*

This is something new that I've never seen before. It's a small cloth glove that fits on your finger to remove makeup.

<br>

<img src="/images/GlossyboxJuly2016GlovQuickTreat2.jpg" border="0" style="border:none;max-width:100%;" alt="Glov Quick Treat Makeup Remover" />
</a></center>

As you can see, this size is meant to be inserted on to your finger. They do come in bigger sizes as I think this might be too small to remove my complete makeup everytime, but it does come in handy when you're traveling on the plane or when space is of essence.

PRODUCT APPLICATION  
The 4 easy steps to use GLOV: moisten with water, remove make-up, hand wash with soap and let it dry for re-use!

From their info, it says that it's reusable for up to 3 months! I will surely put that to the test.

**Bonus Item:**

[![Hello Fresh $50 Gift Card](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJuly2016HelloFreshGiftCard.jpg)](http://glossybox.evyy.net/c/164125/266055/4265){:target="_blank"}

**Hello Fresh** $50 Gift Card*

This Hello Fresh gift card is good for $50 off your first 2 months. Each month costs $40, so in actualy you'll still be paying $ but saving quite a bit. I've tried them in the past before ([you can read my review of it here](http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Hello-Fresh-May-2015-Review/){target="_blank"}) but I guess I'm just too lazy to cook even if the ingredients are provided for me. But I do think it's a great meal subscription to have if you're all about home cooking but with the added convenience of not having to go grocery shopping everytime.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** So last month's box was quite a disappointment and although this month's box faired better, it was still lacking in my opinion. Personally I don't think I would have purchased anything myself if I was given the choice, but since I've already paid for the box, I'm glad that at least I'm able to use every single item in it, so I guess it's still of some value to me. Glossybox is one of those boxes to me where sometimes you receive amazing items and sometimes it's a total miss. But, they do have a great promo going on now though, where you'll receive 2 extra bonus boxes with your first box, so that would totally make the cost of this box a truly great deal. So if you haven't subscribed and are a makeup and skincare junkie, now is probably a great time to try them out. You can always cancel after your first box, just be sure to do it before the 14th of the month prior to your next shipment (e.g. you must cancel by January 14th if you want to cancel your February charge/box).
