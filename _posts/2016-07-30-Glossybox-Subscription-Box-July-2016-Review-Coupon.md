Glossybox is one of those subscription boxes that sends out beauty products such as skincare and makeup. It's different than some beauty subscriptions out there in that the sizes include full sizes - not all, but sometimes quite a few.

<br>

[![First look at unboxing](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJuly2016OpenPackage.jpg)](glossybox.evyy.net/c/164125/266055/4265){:target="_blank"}

First look at unboxing shows the actual Glossybox inside, a pretty pastel pink box that is totally reusable.

<br>

[![Glossybox July 2016 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJuly2016Box.jpg)](glossybox.evyy.net/c/164125/266055/4265){:target="_blank"}

I have a lot of these boxes by now and I use them to keep pretty little things inside.

<br>

[![Glossybox July 2016 Open Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJuly2016OpenBox.jpg)](glossybox.evyy.net/c/164125/266055/4265){:target="_blank"}

Inside you'll find your items nicely packaged and wrapped with tissue paper then finished off with a black ribbon. You also see the info card that they always include with every box.

<br>

The Info Card:

<br>

<H4>Items in Detail:</H4>

[![Fango Essenziali Moisturize Mask](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJuly2016FangoEssenzialiMoisturizeMask.jpg)](glossybox.evyy.net/c/164125/266055/4265){:target="_blank"}

**Fango Essenziali** Moisturize Mask, 1 sheet. *Value $*

This mask will help to deeply moisturize dry skin. It has Avocado, Kelp and Acai berry to name a few of its ingredients. I think I'll be saving this for Winter when my skin actually gets pretty parched.

<br>

[![SINFULSHINE Top Coat](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJuly2016SinfulShineTopCoat.jpg)](glossybox.evyy.net/c/164125/266055/4265){:target="_blank"}

**SINFULSHINE** Top Coat, Full Size. *Value $*

Subscribers received different colors and I am super happy that I got a top coat instead. I was actually in need of one so this couldn't have come at a better time.

<br>

[![Leighton Denny Miracle Mist Speed Drying Spray for Nail Polish](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJuly2016LeightonDennyMiracleMistSpeedDryingSprayNailPolish.jpg)](glossybox.evyy.net/c/164125/266055/4265){:target="_blank"}

**Leighton Denny** Miracle Mist Speed Drying Spray for Nail Polish, Full Size. *Value $*

We all know that when it comes to doing your manicure, time can get lost just by waiting for your newly applied colors to dry. I myself always try to use top coats that will dry fast so that I can continue doing what I need to do instead of sitting around with my hands idle. This spray will help you save time and get you going in no time.

<br>

[![Eyeko Fat Eye Stick](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJuly2016EyekoFatEyeStick.jpg)](glossybox.evyy.net/c/164125/266055/4265){:target="_blank"}

**Eyeko** Fat Eye Stick, Full Size. *Value $*

I have quite a few eyeliners from Eyeko thanks to other subs and they work pretty well. I don't have this type of eye stick though so it'll be great to try. You can use this both as an eyeliner or eyeshadow. Based on how fat it is, I think I'll use it as an eyeshadow.

<br>

[![Glov Quick Treat Makeup Remover](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJuly2016GlovQuickTreat.jpg)](glossybox.evyy.net/c/164125/266055/4265){:target="_blank"}

**Glov** Quick Treat Makeup Remover, Sample Foil Packet. *Value $*

I'm not a big fan of receiving foil packet samples in any of my subs. It just seems cheap and you can get them free anyway from department stores. Oh well, I guess I'll still try it out since it's a makeup remover so I wouldn't need to use it often to see results.

<br>

**Bonus Item:**

[![Hello Fresh $50 Gift Card](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GlossyboxJuly2016HelloFreshGiftCard.jpg)](glossybox.evyy.net/c/164125/266055/4265){:target="_blank"}

**Hello Fresh** $50 Gift Card*

This Hello Fresh gift card is good for $50 off your first 2 months. Each month costs $40, so in actualy you'll still be paying $ but saving quite a bit. I've tried them in the past before ([you can read my review of it here](http://whatsupmailbox.com/subscriptions/reviews/Hello-Fresh-May-2015-Review/){target="_blank"}) but I guess I'm just too lazy to cook even if the ingredients are provided for me. But I do think it's a great meal subscription to have if you're all about home cooking but with the added convenience of not having to go grocery shopping everytime.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** So last month's box was quite a disappointment and although this month's box faired better, it was still lacking in my opinion. A foil packet sample should not be counted as an item and everything else just seemed meh to me. I do appreciate the nail polish top coat and the eyeshadow stick, but I'm not sure those two alone should cost me $21 which is the price of this sub. Oh well, off I go to unsubscribe for awhile until I see some good spoiler or promo to get me to subscribe again.
