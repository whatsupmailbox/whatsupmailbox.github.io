<p>If you're new to Ideel, you can get 10% off your first purchase by <a href="http://www.ideel.com/invite/lorettajie" target="_blank">joining here</a>. That brings the cost down to only $13.28 per box! That's a totes crazy deal!</p>

<p>I subscribed recently through a Ruelala deal, but that didn't stop me from purchasing another one so I got this one as well =P (oh the addict in me failed to be suppressed)</p>

<H4>What's Ideel?</H4>
<p>If you haven't heard of Ideel, it's a website that has boutique sales of designer brands at up to 70 percent off retail every day. Ideel's limited-time sales feature the most sought-after brands in women's apparel, shoes, beauty and accessories, plus must-haves for men and home. Very similar to Ruelala and I totally recommend them!</p>
