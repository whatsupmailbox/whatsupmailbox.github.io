<p><b>Subscription:</b> <a href="http://littlelacebox.com?rfsn=93842.4b16b">Serendipity by Little Lace Box</a></p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> $9.99 bi-monthly (on the off months of the Little Lace Box) with Free Shipping (taxes apply to FL)</p>
<p><b>Products:</b> You'll receive 5-7 sample size (sometimes full-size) items that donâ€™t have any theme attached at all, just great little finds that Little Lace Box wanted to share. So far it's been beauty products and stationary, but we'll see what else they include as this is still new.</p>

<p>They ship in red padded envelopes that are in line with the red boxes they ship for Little Lace Box. Nice touch.</p>

<DT>OFRA Cosmetics - Eyebrow Pencil in Universal</a></DT>
<DD>Full Size .04 oz., Retail Value $12.95</DD>
</DL>

<blockquote>
Water resistant pencil suitable for the most sensitive eye area. It is the perfect solution for your eyebrows and is called Universal Eyebrow Pencil for a reason as it is one color to suit all skin tones.
</blockquote>
<p>I like how this eyebrow pencil goes on smoothly and the color truly is universal, I'm pretty sure anyone can wear this. I do prefer mechanical pencils though since I hate sharpening plus I think it wastes product, but I'm happy to have this and will be using it till it's gone.</p>

<DT>OFRA Cosmetics - Lip Liner in Plum</DT>
<DD>Full Size .04 oz., Retail Value $12.95</DD>
</DL>

<p>This color is quite dark and I was actually in need of a dark lip liner, so it's perfect. Because of the dark color, you can't really see any purple, just dark earthy brown with a hint of purple.</p>
<p>Application was smooth and this pencil is supposed to be water resistance so the color should last. You definitely need a dark lipstick or lipgloss to fill your lips in if you use this liner. I tried multiple colors and only the really dark red/brownish lipsticks or gloss work with this. I like it though, and it goes really well with the lipgloss that they included as well. So let's get on to that item.</p>

<DT>OFRA Cosmetics - Lip Gloss in Bordeaux</DT>
<DD>Full Size 8 g / .27 fl.oz., Retail Value $12.95</DD>
</DL>
<p>Wow, this lip gloss is dark red, and I mean dark. The info card says that it goes on sheer, but um no, it's pretty rich in color. It might be a bit too dramatic or even gothic for some, but I think it would look great on a glammed up night. Perhaps a 1920s or Burlesque theme party? Definitely not one to be used daily unless that's your look.</p>
<p>Color aside, the gloss doesn't feel sticky and has the shine of a lip gloss but not overly shiny. I'm glad I'm being introduced to more OFRA products now thanks to subscription boxes, and so far I have no complaints.</p>

<DT><a href="https://www.alaffia.com/store/pc/Neem-Shea-Butter-Skin-Recovery-Face-Cream-10p121.htm">Alaffia - Neem & Shea Butter Skin Recovery Face Cream</a></DT>
<DD>2 sample packets, $1 each?</DD>
<p>I'm always disappointed when I see foil packets in a subscription box, especially when it's counted as one of the items and not a bonus item. At least they included 2 packets, so I can try it more than once to see the benefits of it.</p>
<p>I do like that it's for problem or acne prone skin, and since I have oily/combination skin, this is right up my alley. This cream is recommended to be used when your skin is in need of intensive moisturizing treatment. Neem leaf extracts and kpangnan butter are ingredients in this product and will add toning and antioxidant properties to restore your skin's natural luminosity.</p>

<DT><a href="http://rockislandsponge.com/index.php?route=common/home">Rock Island Sponge Company</a> - Sea Sponge</DT>
<DD>1 sponge, $1.99?</DD>
<p>This sponge is tiny but will be perfect for face use. From the Bare Bliss Box info sheet, it says that this sponge becomes soft as silk when wet and will gently exfoliate your skin.</p>
<p>There's no documentation or tag that came with it, so I'm not sure what size or type of sponge it is since their website has multiple types. From Caribbean sea sponge, Mediterannean, South Pacific and many more. If I had to guess, it's probably the Caribbean Silk Sponge based on how it looks and the shape, so I based my pricing on that.</p>

<p><b>VERDICT:</b> I can't say if I loved this box or not, it did have some great products, I guess I'm just still disappointed in the foil packet items. The total value came up to $18.38 which is slightly below the cost of the subscription. I've had better boxes from them before and lately their curation hasn't been very great. I purchased a 6-month subscription and still have 2 months left, but I might cancel after if it continues to be below cost. Hopefully their June box will be better.</p>
