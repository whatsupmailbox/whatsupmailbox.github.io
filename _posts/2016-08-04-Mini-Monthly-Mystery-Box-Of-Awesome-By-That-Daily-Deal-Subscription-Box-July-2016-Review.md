**Veggetti Spiral Vegetable Slicer**, *Value $9.99 (Amazon)*

I've always wanted to try one of these devices. It turns veggies into healthy spaghetti! Pasta without the carbs baby! Oh hell yeah.

This slicer has dual stainless-steel cutting blades for thick or thin pasta strands. You can use zucchini, squash, carrots, or cucumbers to name a few. It fits comfortably on my hand and the size is just right. I'm excited to try it out!

**PASS-ACKWORDS Game**, *Value $5.49*

<br>

You can purchase this game online at [Target.com](http://goto.target.com/c/164125/81938/2092){:target="_blank"}. It's a word game for 12 and older, 4 or more people, and playing time is around 30 minutes or less. I've never heard of this game, but we do have game night with friends from time to time so we'll have to try this out and see how fun it is.

**Magic Water Balloons**, *Value $5?*

<br>

I couldn't really find a value for this exact item as there are so many varieties at many different price points. So the value is just based on my personal judgement.

I can't really say I was happy to see this in my package, but hey, it is a mystery box so I can't complain too much. I would not personally use this, but know that our friends who have children will so this will be given to them.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** This is my first Mini Mystery Box and for $9.99 it's actually not that bad. The only thing I won't use are the water balloons, but I'm sure for those who have children they will definitely enjoy them. I will though use the other two items. I think this is a great subscription to have for everyone in the house to unbox and enjoy. Every month is a surprise so you never know who will have the most use of the items sent. I am totally going to continue subscribing because it's just too darn fun to find out what's in the box, plus it's at an affordable price. $10 a month for the whole family to enjoy every month, can't beat that!
