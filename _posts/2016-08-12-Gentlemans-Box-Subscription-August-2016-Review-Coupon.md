[![Open Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxAugust2016OpenBox.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

[![Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxAugust2016InfoMagazine03.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

I find their info magazines to be so very useful. It details each item in the box as well as the brand/creator behind it.

<br>

[![Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxAugust2016InfoMagazine04.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

They also include a section on how to wear all the items in the box together for a super dapper look!

<br>

<H4>And here are all the items:</H4>

[![Gentleman's Box August 2016 Items](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxAugust2016Items.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

This month looks super cool, especially with those awesome sunglasses!

<br>

<H4>Items in detail:</H4>

[![Sunny Rebel Aspen Sunglasses](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxAugust2016SunnyRebelAspenSunglasses.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Sunny Rebel** Aspen Sunglasses, *Value $49*

<br>

Sunglasses, yay! How cool are these! Love the classic frame style and that they included a protective bag for safe keeping. 

<br>

[![Sunny Rebel Aspen Sunglasses](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxAugust2016SunnyRebelAspenSunglasses02.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

It seems like blue reflective glasses are so in these days, and paired with a wooden look frame, definitely trendy and perfect to include in an "Artist" themed box. Because when you're famous, sunglasses are your no.1 friend. Paparazzi flashes ain't got nothing on me, lol!

<br>

[![Sunny Rebel Aspen Sunglasses](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxAugust2016SunnyRebelAspenSunglasses03.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

There's no branding on the side frame, it just looks sleek and classy. Perfect for my husband who doesn't like to be all loud with branding when it comes to his accessories or menswear.

<br>

[![Filthy Etiquette Neck Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxAugust2016FilthyEtiquetteNeckTie.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Filthy Etiquette** Neck Tie, *Value $30*

<br>

This tie has a light purple/pinkish color and it will look great with a grey suit.

<br>

[![Filthy Etiquette Neck Tie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxAugust2016FilthyEtiquetteNeckTie02.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

It's made of 100% cotton and has a smooth feel. Great for wearing during the last days of summer.

<br>


[![Four Fifty Five Pocket Square](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxAugust2016FourFiftyFivePocketSquare.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Four Fifty Five** Pocket Square, *Value $19*

<br>

What a cool way of packaging pocket squares! I'm already impressed!

<br>

[![Four Fifty Five Pocket Square](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxAugust2016FourFiftyFivePocketSquare02.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

The pattern has floral vines all around with lilac lining. It will surely add some pop to your outfit!

<br>

[![Four Fifty Five Pocket Square](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxAugust2016FourFiftyFivePocketSquare03.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

This pocket square is made of 100% cotton and should only be dry cleaned. Hopefully my husband remembers that and doesn't accidently put this in through the washer!

<br>

<br>

[![West End The Hunter Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxAugust2016WestEndSocks02.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**West End** The Hunter Socks, *Value $15*

This is a two-tone striped sock in black, gray and lilac. My husband can never have enough socks, so he's always happy to add more designs into his sock collection. These have a classic striped pattern and the lilac stripes will tie in with both the neck tie and pocket square.

<br>

Here's how it looks on:

<br>

[![West End The Hunter Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxAugust2016WestEndSocks03.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

Looks great, feels great and stays on. No complaints here!

<br>

[![Crusader For Men Eye Serum Complex](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxAugust2016CrusaderEyeSerumComplex.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Crusader For Men** Eye Serum Complex, *Value $32*

Skincare that's specifically targetted for men are few when compared to those for women, so it's always a happy find when there's something that my husband can actually use. 

This eye serum has a roll-on application and feels very refreshing as soon as you apply. It will help reduce wrinkles, dark circles and revitalize the delicate skin around your eyes. My husband has been getting a lot of dark circles lately due to late night work hours so this will surely help! Plus it feels good on too!

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** Gentleman's Box always delivers amazing products that my husband can't wait to use! They are consistent in curating a box with trendy and high quality items, I have yet to be disappointed. This sub is definitely one to have and keep. Especially at the $25 price point, who can beat that! And the total value of this box came up to $151, that's incredible! Such a great value and a must have if you are looking to subscribe to a box full of men's accessories!
