<p><i class="icon-dropbox"></i> Their next box is "Oui Please Vol. 2.1 La Vie en Rose" and just by the theme alone I'm super excited! Boxes will start delivering in March.</p>

<p>And to build the excitement, here are some spoilers:</p>

</a></center>

<p>All of the brands above, Les Petites..., Nuxe and Le Chocolat des Fran√ßais will be included in ALL boxes!</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> Spoilers always gets me super excited. Plus this spoiler states that all boxes will be getting these brand products. Eeeek, I wonder what type of Les Petites... items will they send out, sweaters (I wish!), belts, or perhaps jewelry? Can't wait to find out, this is such a tease! Will update you if I find out anything else, and here's to hoping <a href="http://ouipleasebox.com" target="_blank">Oui Please</a> delivers soon!</p>

<p>If you haven't subscribed yet, you can <a href="http://ouipleasebox.com" target="_blank"><big>subscribe here</big></a> and use coupon code <b>OUILAVIEENROSE</b> to get 20% off any subscription. That brings the cost down to $120 (reg. $150) for one box or $520 (reg. $650) for a whole year! That's an amazing deal!</p>
