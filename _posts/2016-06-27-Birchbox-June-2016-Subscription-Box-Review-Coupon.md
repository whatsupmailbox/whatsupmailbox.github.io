So I've been taking a break from [Birchbox](https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox){:target="_blank"} because I just had way too many makeup and skincare in my stash thanks to sub boxes. But I just had to come back when there was a Gift With Subscription announced for a free Smith & Cult lipgloss (no longer available). I love their nail polishes and have been dying to try out their new lipglosses so this was a deal that I couldn't pass up!

<br>

[![Birchbox June 2016 Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/BirchboxJune2016Box.jpg)](https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox){:target="_blank"}

Every month Birchbox designs a new design for their boxes and this month's theme is supposed to be magical so they've included multiple colors in a mesmerizing diamond pattern.

<br>

[![Birchbox June 2016 Open Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/BirchboxJune2016OpenBox.jpg)](https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox){:target="_blank"}

First look at unboxing reveals their info/welcome card on the top.

<br>

[![Birchbox June 2016 Open Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/BirchboxJune2016OpenBox2.jpg)](https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox){:target="_blank"}

Birchbox now includes a soft padding at the bottom of their boxes! I know it's been awhile since I subscribed to them, but this is new to me. It definitely helps to secure the products inside from moving too much during shipment, therefore less leakage and damage.

<br>

The Info Card:

<br>

<H4>And here are my Birchbox June 2016 items:</H4>

[![Birchbox June 2016 Items](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/BirchboxJune2016Items.jpg)](https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox){:target="_blank"}

<br>

<H4>Items in Detail:</H4>

[![Dr. Jart+ Every Sun Day SPF 30 UV Sun Fluid](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/BirchboxJune2016DrJartEverySunDaySunscreenSPF30.jpg)](https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox){:target="_blank"}

**Dr. Jart+** Every Sun Day SPF 30 UV Sun Fluid, *Value $8.50*

This sunscreen can be used both on the face or body. It's lightweight, nonsticky (it absorbed really fast and was not oily or greasy), plus there was no evident scent.

<br>

[![Oribe Cream, Whish Shave Cream, Kiehl's Serum](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/BirchboxJune2016OribeWhishKiehls.jpg)](https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox){:target="_blank"}

**Oribe** Supershine Moisturizing Cream, *Value $5*

The multitasking formula of this cream acts as both a leave-in conditioner and a styling cream. It will help to smooth your hair, add some shine and moisturize at the same time.

I love Oribe! Their products are quality and have done wonders to my hair. This also smells amazing so I'm excited to try this!

<br>

**Whish** Shave Cream with Vitamin K, *Value $3.50*

This shave cream is ultrasoothing with organic jojoba seed oil, green tea, and coconut oil that will deeply moisturize and calm your skin, while the natural squalane reverses roughness and dryness with omega-3 fatty acids. It also has a blend of natural plant extracts plus vitamin K that acts to minimize spider veins, varicose veins, and bruises over time.

I've tried their body lotions before and loved it, so I'm happy to try this out, especially since my current one just ran out.

<br>

**Kiehl's** Precision Lifting & Pore-Tightening Concentrate, *Value $6.40*

Kiehl's is a well known brand in the skincare industry and although I've used them now and then, I'm not a regular but I'm open to trying. 

"This concentrated blend is clinically tested to restore elasticity and tighten pores with just a few drops. Micro-filtered yeast extract minimizes pores and lifts skin to redefine facial contours, while antioxidant-rich geranium and rosemary oils visibly improve skin’s texture and overall appearance."

<br>

[![Ardency Inn Modster Smooth Ride Supercharged Eyeliner](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/BirchboxJune2016ArdencyInnModsterEyeliner.jpg)](https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox){:target="_blank"}

**Ardency Inn** Modster Smooth Ride Supercharged Eyeliner, Deluxe Sample Size (2/3 of Full Size) *Value $13.50*

I love black eyeliners, especially waterproof ones like this, but I prefer them in a twist up style rather than this manual sharpening type. I find that it wastes product and I get lazy in sharpening them. But nevertheless, I will use this at some point I'm sure.

<br>

<H4>Gift With Subscription:</H4>

[![Smith & Cult Lipgloss](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/BirchboxJune2016GWSSmithAndCultLipgloss.jpg)](https://www.birchbox.com/invite/whatsupmailbox){:target="_blank"}

**Smith & Cult** The Shining Lip Lacquer in Her Name is Bubbles, *Value $22*

Love the coral pink color of this gloss! It's also not too shiny despite its name, and I find that it wasn't too sticky as well. My lips felt moisturized and it did last even after drinking throughout the day. Great lipgloss and I just may need to get more!

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** Although I'm not too impressed with my items this time, I am glad I resubsribed with their Gift With Subscription coupon and received a free Smith & Cult lipgloss which totally made this box worth it. If I didn't have that, I'd say it was just an oh-kay box. The only item that I could say I was happy and excited about was the Oribe hair cream and the Whish shave cream. Everything else will probably just stay in my skincare stash until I find myself really in need of it.
