<p>French Box just released a sneak peak today for their May 2015 Cannes theme box!</p>

<p>*FYI, they always include a post card every month that's in line with their theme.</p>

<p>So far so good, and hopefully they'll release more spoilers before the boxes get shipped, and as always, I'll post any updates if there is one. #IPromise</p>

<p>And just in case you missed it, I did a post a few days ago about them relaunching their subscription boxes after being in hiatus for a few months, you can read all about it <a href="http://whatsupmailbox.com/french%20box/FrenchBox-May2015-News/">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Box:</b> <a href="https://getfrenchbox.com">French Box</a></p>
<p><b>The Cost:</b> $36 bi-monthly with Free Priority Mail shipping</p>
<p><b>What's in the box:</b> A minimum of 5 French products in fashion, cosmetics, gourmet, accessories and other surprises. 
The products in the box are usually either produced, distributed or designed in France.
They can also be from a French brand, popular in France or part of the French culture.</p>
