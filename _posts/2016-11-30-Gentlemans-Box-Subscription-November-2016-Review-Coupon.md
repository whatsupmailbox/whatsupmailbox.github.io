[![Gentlemen Of The North Classic Toque](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxNovember2016GentlemenOfTheNorthClassicToque.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Gentlemen Of The North** Classic Toque, *Value $30*

What a great item to find in a subscription box! GOTN is a Canadian brand and toque is actually another name for beanie. I'll be heading to Canada next month and knowing that it's definitely going to be a lot colder there than here in California, this is totally going with us for my husband to wear.

The light grey color makes this beanie versatile (perfect for traveling) and the fabric is soft yet thick to keep your head and ears warm during the winter months. Such a great item to include and so happy to receive this!

<br>

[![DEAD SOXY Teddy Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxNovember2016DeadSoxyTeddySocks.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**DEAD SOXY** Teddy Socks, *Value $25*

My husband loves receiving socks since he can never have too many of them. He's also well aware of this brand since it's frequently featured in subscription boxes, but he loves the brand and the quality of socks that they make so this was also happily received.

Their socks have a good fit and don't slide down, and after multiple washes, the colors remain quite vibrant. This particular design, "The Teddy" is one of many styles that will be introduced in their new line of socks.

<br>

[![Quinton Shaw Anchor Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxNovember2016QuintonShawAnchorBracelet.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Quinton Shaw** Anchor Bracelet, *Value $35*

This anchor bracelet is made of leather and the anchor pendant actually comes in gold, rose gold or silver plated. Subscribers received gold and it's just perfect.

<br>

[![Quinton Shaw Anchor Bracelet](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxNovember2016QuintonShawAnchorBracelet02.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

I like that the band is made of thin leather, most of the wrap bracelets are thick and only wrap twice, but because this is thin, it actually wraps around four times. It looks great by itself or layered with another piece, and the dark brown color also will go great with any outfit.

<br>

[![Wine Aerator](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxNovember2016WineAerator.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Wine Aerator**, *Value $10*

I think I'm going to take this for myself seeing as I am the wine drinker in the house. And can I just say, hurray to Gentleman's Box for sending a cool tool that's so very useful especially during the holiday season. It's so easy to use too, just open your bottle of red wine, pop this into the opening and pour away. You'll be amazed at how better your red wine tastes with an aerator, it's life changing.

<br>

[![Lucky Scruff Beard Oil](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxNovember2016LuckyScruffBeardOil.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Lucky Scruff** Beard Oil, *Value $10*

This beard oil will condition your beard for a soft and manageable feel rather than having it oily or weighed down. It also smells great, with the scent of frankincense and a hint of mahogany. Although my husband rarely grows a beard, once in awhile he'll let it go but it still won't grow that long, so he'll most likely gift this to his buddy with a more prominent beard.

<br>

[![Gold Bond Hydrating Cream](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/GentlemansBoxNovember2016GoldBondHydratingCream.jpg)](http://mbsy.co/d7GnS){:target="_blank"}

**Gold Bond** Hydrating Cream, Sample Size 0.75 oz. *$bonus*

Because this is a bonus item, the value was not included.

Here in California, it's almost always dry so we tend to need lotions more often all year long. The winter months especially and since most moisturizers are targeted towards women, my husband tends to stray away from using it since the scents are all floral or feminine. Seeing that Gold Bond made one specifically for men, my husband will surely be open to trying this out. It's non-greasy formula is also a plus and you can use this for your body, hands and face.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** I LOVED this box! It had such a great variety of items that's perfect for winter and oh-so useful too! Instead of the regular ties and pocket squares, I was pleasantly surprised at the cool stuff that this month brings. Definitely the best box I've received as of yet! And with a total value of $116 for a $25 box, that's more than quadruple the cost, yay for amazing value! Can't rave enough about this subscription, not only is it great to have for yourself as a gentleman, but it also makes for a great gift!
