If you're a planner addict such as myself, you know how it can be so fun to decorate your planners with cute and useful stickers. I just can't seem to have enough of it! And since there are a handful of subscriptions that fulfill my planner needs, I'm always looking for new ones to try.

Panduh Box is a fairly new subscription. It launched in September 2015 and I've kept my eye on it since it started and decided that I now NEED it! So here goes my first review!

<br>

![Panduh Box June 2016 Open box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/PanduhBoxJune2016OpenBox.jpg)

First look at unboxing has gotten me all ooh and ahh-ing. I love the tropical vibes going on in this box theme and the paper umbrellas attached to inside lid of the box definitely added a nice touch!

<br>

<H4>Note from the curator:</H4>

The front side of the note features a bright yellow pineapple with the title of this month's theme, "Tropical Vibes".

A note from the owner/curator Maricris Emma describing the theme this month and what went behind her curation. Every month also comes with a special discount code to shop in the [Paper Panduh shop](http://www.paperpanduh.com){:target="_blank"}.

<br>

<H4>And here are all the items in June's box:</H4>

**Assorted Die Cuts**

So many pretty die cuts as well as a couple of note cards. Loving all the pastel and bright colors, this will definitely be put to use in my scrapbooking!

<br>

![Panduh Box June 2016 Washi Tapes](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/PanduhBoxJune2016TropicalWashiTapes.jpg)

**Pink with gold foil Washi Tapes** (2 rolls)

How pretty are these washi tapes! Pink and gold are one of my favorite combos so needless to say, these will go everywhere in my planner. I love washi tapes, they are so multifunctional and it doesn't hurt that they look pretty no matter where you put them! Another plus is that these washi tapes can just be ripped off thanks to its paper material, so no need to have a scissor on hand.

[Sweet Maluhia - The Chalky Marina Makeup Bag](https://www.sweetmaluhia.com/products/the-chalky-marina-collection?variant=20233953601), *Value $15*

This makeup/pencil bag screams Hawaii to me, Aloha indeed. It's quite roomy to fit a lot of planner tools such as pencils, pens, washi tapes, erasers, etc.

<br>

The prints on these notepads match the stickers that you'll see later on in this review. I love the pineapple design of course, it's just so stinkin cute!

Now on to the stickers!

How pretty are these stickers and they look so lovely in my Webster's Pages planner. I LOVE it! And it came in time for my weeklong girl time with my little sis, just perfect!

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** My first Panduh Box was amazing and I loved everything from the items to the packaging. It was totally worth the $29.95 cost and I can't believe I didn't sign up for this subscription sooner! If you're a planner addict like me, I say try this box out. It will certainly satisfy your need for stickers, decorations and more. I'm also a big fan of supporting independent women who create a business out of their passion and this truly shows from Emma's creation so I totally support that. June's theme is also right up my alley, who doesn't like tropical vibes in the summer! I can't wait to receive my July box, themed "Treat Yo' Self" so stay tuned for my review of that later this month!

Interested in subscribing? You can go to [www.panduhbox.com](http://www.panduhbox.com){:target="_blank"} to start receiving their monthly planner boxes! Subscribe before the 15th to get the current month's box.
