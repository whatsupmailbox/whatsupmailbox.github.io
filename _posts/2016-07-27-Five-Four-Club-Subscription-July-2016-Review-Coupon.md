When you subscribe to [Five Four Club](http://fivefourclub.7eer.net/c/164125/122548/2570){:target="_blank"}, you take a profile survey to input your size and style preferences. My husband selected "Casual" as his style with a preference in vibrant rich colors. There are 4 options in style; Classic, Casual, Fashion Forward or a Mix of all.

<br>

<H4>Based on my husband's "Casual" profile, here is what they sent:</H4>

**Ferry Modern Swim Trunk** in Blue

I received swim trunks in my package last month and now I get another one, how lucky! The colors and pattern are very pool/beach appropriate.

<br>

The back side of the trunks show their brand and a hidden pocket.

These trunks have a mesh lining inside and is made of 100% polyester.

<br>

Here's how it looks on:

These trunks will definitely get a lot of use in the pool as it is hot hot hot right now in Los Angeles!

**Hickory Henley** in Wine color

This is a nice basic red t-shirt that's soft and breathable.

<br>

Their branding can be seen at the bottom right side of the shirt.

The color suits me and the style is classic, one that I would purchase myself. Plus it can be worn layered when the weather gets colder.

<br>

[![Five Four Club Wainscott White Polo](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/FiveFourClubJuly2016WainscottWhitePolo.jpg)](http://fivefourclub.7eer.net/c/164125/122548/2570){:target="_blank"}

**Wainscott Polo** in White

Polos are great for those business casual days. It's relaxed yet shows profesionalism at the same time.

<br>

[![Five Four Club Wainscott White Polo](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/FiveFourClubJuly2016WainscottWhitePolo2.jpg)](http://fivefourclub.7eer.net/c/164125/122548/2570){:target="_blank"}

There's a yacht type of logo on it and I believe it's their branding for the summer collection.

<br>

It's a basic and classic polo and the white color is definitely appreciated especially in the hot California summer days. It will look great paired with pretty much anything.

[![Five Four Club Adamson Dress Shirt Gray](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/FiveFourClubJuly2016AdamsonDressShirtGray.jpg)](http://fivefourclub.7eer.net/c/164125/122548/2570){:target="_blank"}

**Adamson Dress Shirt** in Gray

It was certainly a pleasant surprise to find a long sleeve collared shirt in the package. It's a nice variety to have from all the casual items I've been receiving from them lately.

<br>

Here's a closer look at the collar:

And here's a picture of the shirt on:

This shirt is slim fit with a checkered pattern.

[![Five Four Club Ash Blue Zip Hoodie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/FiveFourClubJuly2016AshBlueZipHoodie.jpg)](http://fivefourclub.7eer.net/c/164125/122548/2570){:target="_blank"}

**Ash Zip Hoodie** in Blue

As July is coming to an end (time sure flies!) and we're getting closer to Fall, it seems appropriate to send this hoodie and prepare for cooler weather. Although it may be some time before that happens here in LA, the nights do get cool and hoodies are definitely an item that my husband can never have enough of!

<br>

Here's a closer look at the hood section:

[![Five Four Club Ash Blue Zip Hoodie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/FiveFourClubJuly2016AshBlueZipHoodie2.jpg)](http://fivefourclub.7eer.net/c/164125/122548/2570){:target="_blank"}

<br>

And here's how it looks on:

[![Five Four Club Ash Blue Zip Hoodie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/FiveFourClubJuly2016AshBlueZipHoodie3.jpg)](http://fivefourclub.7eer.net/c/164125/122548/2570){:target="_blank"}

My husband paired it with the collared shirt to show how versatile hoodies can be, it can be worn with casual t-shirts or with more business like shirts. It actually also looks great with the other two tops that's in the package, he just didn't want to model it all.

<br>

[![Five Four Club Coney Black No Show Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/FiveFourClubJuly2016ConeyBlackNoShowSocks.jpg)](http://fivefourclub.7eer.net/c/164125/122548/2570){:target="_blank"}

**Coney No-Show Socks** in Black

I received these socks in my package last month as well but in a blue and red color. My husband absolutely loved them so he's happy he received another pair!

<br>

[![Five Four Club Coney Black No Show Socks](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/FiveFourClubJuly2016ConeyBlackNoShowSocks2.jpg)](http://fivefourclub.7eer.net/c/164125/122548/2570){:target="_blank"}

These socks have a non-slip heel patch inside of the socks where the heel would go. It works really well and did not slip down at all after a day's worth of walking.

<br>

As I mentioned last month, totally love the "left" and "right" sign on the socks!

<br>

These no-show socks are perfect for when you're wearing loafers.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Five Four Club totally nailed the style for my husband this month! All the items were both weather appropriate as well as seasonally in style. I also like the fact that they have swimming trunks for the summer, and that I actually received one. With all the items I received this month, it was totally worth the cost if not more. So happy I resubscribed and can't wait to see what they'll send next month!
