![Etsy Haul: Simply Gilded](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/SimplyGildedHaulSep2016.jpg)

Don't you just love pretty stationery products?! I can never have enough of them and I find myself constantly browsing [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com){:target="blank"} for more - I may have a problem.

I found this cute shop [Simply Gilded](https://www.etsy.com/shop/SimplyGildedCo?ref=l2-shopheader-name){:target="blank"} and just fell in love with some of her designs and had to make a purchase. Especially since there was a set of washi and planner clip that was made in collaboration with [The Creative Bee Shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/TheCreativeBeeShop?ref=shop_sugg){:target="blank"}, another great Etsy shop that makes cute planner clips, it didn't take long before I clicked next, next and done!

Shipping was fast and her packaging was pretty too, that bunny is so darn cute! So happy all these beauties are in my collection now and I can't wait to use them!

<H2>What's Etsy?</H2>

If you're not aware of [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com){:target="blank"}, it's a marketplace where creative and artistic people sell their products and creations. I've been obsessed with them since way back when I was planning my wedding (almost 6 years ago!) and have been buying tons of stuff ever since. #guilty
