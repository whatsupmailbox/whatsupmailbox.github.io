<p>When you subscribe to <a href="https://www.fivefourclub.com/getstarted?referrer=RE731318" target="_blank">Five Four Club</a>, you take a profile survey to input your size and style preferences. My husband selected "Fashion Forward" as his style with a preference in vibrant rich colors. There are 4 options in style; Classic, Casual, Fashion Forward or a Mix of all.</p>

<br>

<H4>Based on my husband's "Fashion Forward" profile, here is what they sent:</H4>

<DT>Hinoki White Sweater</DT>
</DL>

<p><i>Material: 83% Cotton, 17% Polyester</i></p>

<p>This sweater is light in material so it'll be great for the cool nights here in California. The color and style is also versatile so it can be worn day or night. Plus during the colder weather, you can layer this under a jacket for extra warmth and style.</p>

<DT>Tyron Blue Slim Jeans</DT>

<p><i>Material: 95% Cotton, 4% Elasterell, 1% Spandex</i></p>

<p>I love it when they send a pair of jeans. My husband's style profile states his pereference in slim fitted pants hence the slim jeans. This is the second pair of jeans that they've sent us and I find the quality to be great. Plus the material is quite stretchy too so it makes it super comfortable to wear.</p>

<p>The front style of the jeans are classic with the 5-pocket design.</p>

<p>The branding on the backside is also simple and clean.</p>

<p>And here's a look at both items on a model from their website:</p>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Can't complain about the items this month, especially with the jeans! California may be hot and sunny, but it can still get quite cool during the night so a lightweight sweater is a must have. So both items are totally appropriate for my husband, both in style and in comfort. And they both match perfectly when worn together. I can't say enough good things about this subscription, it's definitely a must have if you're either too busy to shop for clothing or need to step up your style. Definitely worth the price in my opinion, plus their customer service is stellar!</p>

<p>If you haven't subscribed yet, you can <a href="https://www.fivefourclub.com/getstarted?referrer=RE731318" target="_blank">get $25 off your first package through this link</a>. That brings the cost down to $35 for 2-3 clothing items!</p>
