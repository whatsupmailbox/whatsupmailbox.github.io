[Trendy Butler](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"} is a subscription that delivers brand name and trendy menswear based on a style profile that you complete upon subscribing. Not only do they take your profile into consideration when selecting items for you, they also take into account your location to send you appropriate weather clothes, how awesome is that! And since my husband hates shopping, this subscription has been a life saver for him!

<br>

[![First look at unpacking](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/TrendyButlerJanuary2017OpenPackage.jpg)](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"}

Trendy Butler sends their items in a thick brown paper envelope and when you open that, you see the items packaged neatly inside.

<br>

<H4>Based on my husband's profile, here is what they sent:</H4>

[![Trendy Butler - Cohesive & Co. Allen Rust Thermal Hoodie](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/TrendyButlerJanuary2017CohesiveCoSweater.jpg)](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"}

**Cohesive & Co.** Allen Rust Thermal Hoodie, *Value $113*

This sweater is just my husband's style! It's simple yet with a modern touch of style. The color is stated as fatigue, which is like a rusty green in my opinion, and it will go great with black or blue jeans, or even khakis and you're good to go!

<br>

A closer look at the pockets:

The quilted antiqued pockets and elbow patches gives this hoodie a unique look. I think it will look good on women too and if this were smaller, I'd wear it myself! =)

[![Trendy Butler - Rogue Black Jeans](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/TrendyButlerJanuary2017RogueBlackJeans.jpg)](http://trendybutlers.com/l/B9A76CA0/){:target="_blank"}

**Rogue State** Black Jeans, *Value $125?*

I couldn't really find this exact style online for pricing, but did find something similar with a slight pattern difference for $125 and used that for value.

My last package had black jeans as well but since my husband wears them quite often, this new pair was happily welcomed.

<br>

Here's a closer look at the jeans:

<br>

The jeans has a slim straight fit which is perfect for my husband's built. The material is 78% cotton and 22% polyester, but there was little to no stretch on these at all, it was quite stiff. It still fit my husband nicely, but the comfort level could have been increased with some stretch.

<br>

And here's how it looks on:

I love the color combination of this outfit, definitely an everyday style that you can wear.

You can see the quilted elbow patches on this pic, it adds a touch of style and is great for someone who likes to keep it simple yet modern.

<br>

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> This month's look was super chill and cool. Black jeans are always on trend and the rusty green hoodie was definitely the winner of this outfit. My husband loves the style, the fabric, the color - it's just <i>perfect</i>. Another great package from Trendy Butler, and a great start to the year!
