<p>A couple of spoilers were released prior, but Luxor Box is different in a way where they only release the brand name and you get to dream up all sorts of guesses or wishes as to what the actual item may be. So it still gets to be a surprise. I actually like that since you still get to be excited about the product without really knowing what it is. Oh the suspense.</p>
<br>

<H4>And here are the items inside:</H4>

<p>This bracelet was revealed last month as an item in the box, but it was so long ago that I actually forgot about it. I love the design - simple, clean and chic - and I also LOVE that it's gold.</p>

<br>

<p>With a value of $298, this bracelet is quite a gem. I would never have purchased this myself especially at that price, but that's why I subscribe to these boxes since now I can have it without spending that dough!</p>

<p>When I did try it on, for some reason it was scratching my hands, like there were some sharp edges. Turns out the ends of the bracelet where you insert your hand was either knicked off or slight pieces broke off and that created sharp edges. I emailed Luxor Box right away and they replied the next day (I emailed at night) with instructions on how to mail it back to them and once they receive it they'll mail out a replacement as soon as possible. I do hope it won't take too long because I love this bracelet and can't wait to use it!</p>

<p>There are 4 variations in color that subscribers will receive.

Although I do have blue in my decor, it's more of a tourquise blue so I'm not sure that this will fit. But it is quite pretty so I will surely find a place for this.</p>

<p>There was a Pura Vida makeup pouch in the last Luxor Box (you can read my review of it here), so I was surprised to see this brand again this time around. Subscribers received either this set, Mint Body Lotion & Cleanser, or the Mint Shampoo & Conditioner set.</p>

<p>I love the scent of mint so this was perfect for me. I'm also glad I got the body lotion and cleanser versus the hair set as I'm a bit more picky on what I use for my hair. With all the lotions I've been getting lately in my subscription boxes, winter has nothing on me!</p>

<p>This brand was also in my previous Popsugar box, but it was a difusser that smelled oh-so-good! So of course I'm happy that I received another product by them. As soon as I opened the box, I noticed an amazing scent and now I know, this is it! Love it!</p>

<p>Made with soy wax and natural wick, this is surely my type of candle and I absolutely adore the glass jar and will be reusing it once the candle is gone.</p>

<p>What an interesting item. It's supposed to be a pad for you to jot your ideas or anything you need to write at a moment's notice. It comes with 100 extra refills and the size is small enough to insert into your pocket. I'm not sure I'll be able to use this, so I might gift it.</p>

<br>

<p><i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i><b> My Thoughts:</b> Hmmm, I'm not sure I'm in love with this box, it just wasn't "luxor" enough for me. I had an issue with the bracelet which is not a good sign of quality from that brand, the vase was meh, and the idea cards are like "what is this all about". </p>
