[Emma & Chloe](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"} is a French jewelry subscription box that ships 1 jewelry item every month that's made in France. They initially only shipped to Europe but started shipping to U.S. this year (so happy when that happened!). And since I love everything French, I subscribed in a heartbeat!

When you first subscribe, you'll be prompted to answer a couple of questions regarding your jewelry preferences.

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Jewelry Preferences](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/Emma-Chloe-Jewelry-Preferences.png)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}

And as a bonus for being a subscriber, you'll also receive 20% discount on anything in their online shop!

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Package](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeJune2016Package.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}

Their boxes ships through DHL and it typically takes about a week to arrive to me (Los Angeles). They're packaged in white bubble wrap padded envelopes, unmarked so it's safe from prying eyes.

<br>

I say this all the time, but I just love how they're boxes are! They're different than any other boxes I receive from other subs and they feel so luxe and look so chic. It's also made of thick and sturdy cardboard material so you can totally reuse them!

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Open Box](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeJune2016OpenBox.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}
 
The box opens up like a book which is quite unique in the subscription world. I personally like that a lot. It makes it easier to open and close versus boxes that have a lid on them.

First look at unboxing shows their jewelry pouch as well as their info magazine, "La Gazette".

<br>

**The Info Magazine, La Gazette:**

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeJune2016InfoMagazine.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}

Their Info Magazine is quite thick and full of useful details as you'll see in the pics below.

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeJune2016InfoMagazine2.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}

The first page is their Table of Contents. So many useful contents!

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeJune2016InfoMagazine3.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}

A section on Parisian summer fashion.

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeJune2016InfoMagazine4.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}

They also always seem to have a "Homemade Beauty" section and this month they focus on honey and how to incorporate that ingredient to make your own homemade beauty product. How useful and amazing is this!

<br>

[Emma & Chloe](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"} sends their monthly jewelry pieces in these black drawstring pouches. Because what good are your jewelry if it's not kept properly right? I'm not sure if they're anti tarnish, but they are super handy for when you need to travel and separate your jewels from scratching each other.

<br>

<H4>And here is this month's jewelry item:</H4>

[![Emma & Chloe June 2016 Item - Louise Hendricks Mara Necklace Silver](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeJune2016LouiseHendricksMaraNecklaceSilver.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}

**Louise Hendricks** Mara Necklace in Silver, *Value $89*

Another blue jewelry item! My item in May also incorporated blue gems and since I'm having a major crush on this color this summer, I am super happy to receive this!

<br>

Details of the bracelet in the info magazine:

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe May 2016 Info Magazine](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeJune2016InfoMagazine5.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}

Subscribers will receive this necklace in either gold or silver (depending on your preference) and although gold is my preferred metal of choice, sometimes silver just looks better on certain outfits. FYI, you can have them surprise you with either gold or silver, instead of the same metal for every shipment, as that is a choice you can select in your style preference.

<br>

Here's a closer look of the necklace:

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe May 2016 Azucar Lapis Cuff Gold](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeJune2016LouiseHendricksMaraNecklaceSilver2.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}

This necklace is gold plated with a bar pendant that has a row of turquoise stones. I find the style to be simple yet chic, plus you can wear this alone for a minimalistic look or layered for extra glam.

The Azucar brand can be seen on the inner side of the cuff towards one of the ends.

<br>

[![Emma & Chloe - Louise Hendricks Certificate of Authenticity](http://whatsupmailbox.com/images/EmmaChloeJune2016LouiseHendricksCertificateOfAuthenticity.jpg)](http://www.emma-chloe.com/us/){:target="_blank"}

They also include a "Certificate of Authenticity" with every jewelry item, so you know it's 100% authentic, gorgeous and precious too!

<br>

Here's a look at the bracelet on me:

<br>

I wanted the blue to stand out so I wore it with a bright pink summer dress and I loved the look! This gorgeous lapis bracelet has surely honored its presence into my jewelry collection!

**Emma & Chloe Postcard:**

With every box, Emma & Chloe also includes a postcard with the front picture being a model wearing the jewelry item of the month.

<i class="icon-exclamation-sign"></i> **My Thoughts:** It's such a treat to open up my Emma & Chloe boxes, I'm always looking forward to see what they send everytime! And knowing that the jewels are from French designers, I know that it's unique and truly special. And the quality, such high quality that you rarely see in costume jewelry especially with the $35 price! The necklace that this month brings is simple in design but chic in everyway with it's I can't rave enough about this subscription and it is one that I treasure and will keep subscribing for as long as they deliver!
